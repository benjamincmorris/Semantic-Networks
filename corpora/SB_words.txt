so you dont need to go borrow equipment from anybody to to do the feet do the hooves  were gonna have to find somewhere to get something so mae im gonna mae lynne xx were not gonna do the feet today im gonna wait till like early in the morning to do those cause y i mean you get s ti n you just it takes uh well it takes me longer than most people cause you know im not as stro and and im not as good as like somebody that would do it all the ti you know i mean uh oh i mean i trim horses and stuff like that but i mean im not like im no uh i dont know how to say it but you know they do it for a living you know most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the ti and im not that good or and im not very strong did they train you yeah did they train you that x yeah yeah so you have your own equipment but no i dont have my own equipment at all da you know has done some of it thats another thing too is i kinda had a b general idea of kinda how to do it just watching hi or and watching people come to our place and doing it and stuff you know and i dont know then down there um its mandatory you have to uh to graduate you know or well to get the degree you know you have to take this class and you can only take if you want to you can only take it for eight weeks and if you wanna go on in it you n then you can go on you know and i decided to go ahead and go on in it and the first part of it is like well we have lecture then we have la and like the first part of it we just go into the classroo and he like in the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work i mean it thats just kinda how it happens you know because he kinda has to tell you they go over the who the who part of the horse i mean all the skeleton part of it you know and and they go through every kinda ligament and i mean theres millions of ligaments and millions of tendons you know well not millions but i mean yeah i bet and then so we had to know these tendons and ligaments and then all the bones and you know all the way up from the shou down and then from the hip down you know all the way down to the hoof and then uh the bo in the hoof and then all the wall and uh you know of the hoof and what everything was called there and then he went over on how to trim it and where you th theres a white line that you go by and a horse has this little white line and you clean it out with the with the hoof knife you know and then there uh and then you can see this little white line and thats kinda where you go by to uh you know the horse kinda helps you out because it has that little white line right the mhm and that where you kinda kinda need a little guide of where you trim and i am still scared to do it because uh_you know i mean you can make a horse go lame by doing it really well you can trim em too short uh and make em you know and theyre just a little bit for f the first couple of days you know i mean theyre just sore thats not bad but sometimes you can get it really bad you can really make a horse really bad and they m you know then uh they have to like keep em away from anything you know get em really in the so ground and no hard pebbles or hard clods of dirt or anything so uh uh i dont know im a little scared about doing it yet you know i get em really long i mean theyre still long when i get done with them a lo of times like ill get done and ill think im done and ill look at look down at the horses hoof and its still its too long and then like i would never ever ever trust myself to shoe a horse see we did that too we did we did a lot of stuff we did a lot of stuff with the like we had the um the bur you know and youd put the youd have you started out with the straight iron you know and youd stick it into the into the you know like actual bla and youd put it into the ho coa you know and then wed uh i i straight bar and wed make it a a horseshoe out of it you know but uh these shoes we never did put on a horse we just put the shoes that were already made on a horse and thats as far as we got i mean if you would really get into it well as a matter of fact this is really funny you know there isnt really any girl farriers around anywhere theyre really farrier th yeah farrier is what theyre called and the m uh the reason they were showing us this at college was just to get us to know if our trimmer and shoer were_s doing it right and plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments which we we had it in another class too we that was kind of a double thing that uh we had in in another class so it was kinda review for us well it was a review for some people depend on what time of the year you took it you know if it was a review or not but anyway um what was i gonna say i forgot what i was think you sai you never made the horseshoes gonna say but well uh w u uh when we put em on a horses hoof all we do theyre already made theyre round we pick out a size you know wed like look at the horses hoof and say okay this is a doubleaught this is an aught this is you know what s what size and doubleaught and aught uh are the ones that are most popular uh for you know the light horse you know i mean you get into the big horses the like the clydesdales shires thats a d a whole different thing or ponies thats a whole different thing but were talking just the regular light horses you know a aught and aught uh augh and doubleaught are the two sizes well anyway you go get your okay this is after you trimmed em and you go get your shoe its already made its already round you pick out your size uh_you go look and every horses hoof is shaped different it doesnt matter every horse is gonna have a little different shape and so what you have to do so every every uh horseshoe is made custommade for the horse then no no no what what we do then thats thats where the ferrier comes in every shoe is like you get order you know i would like a b case of doubleaught shoes youd get the ferrier gets em you know thats the way it goes and then uh_our job is to shape the shoe to the horses foot and that it d it sounds easy but its really hard to do i mean some of em you have to uh you know like say okay say your shoes uh like thi and your horses foot is just really wide or something well then you have to put it on the anvil and get the shoe stretched out well then once you stretch the shoe out well then the two corners they go out too you know okay your shoes like this you stretch this out well then its gonna make these go way out too and they get like this right then you have to round these back you know its just uh it s it sounds easy but its really hard to do and then i would never do it cause id never trust myself to do it i mean we ha to do it but its just that people would volunteer their horses to the college because it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod i mean thats just how much it costs could you imagine all those horses out there if we had em all shod thats how many have you got thirty bucks for twenty horses twen twen horses you know i mean jesus that would be a th nine hundred dollars just like tha i mean could you imagine so w you know like a lot of people that have a lot of horses and stuff and that theyre riding a lot theyll just let the college kids do em for em you know theyre taking the risk of having their horse get lame but it really never happens cause we have our s instructor right there telling us this is what you do and its not like theres a person thats just gung ho and goes and just trims their feet and puts the shoe on you know you d you d you ca do that and so we have our instructor right there and we asked a million questions all the time i mean he e he just runs around everywhere you know so its uh but uh what was i gonna say uh oh and its really tiring though and it uh you know like you get so i only done like well at the end of the year now see i took the second half of the course and uh right now ive probably only shod about five horses trimmed a lot of em and you know what we start out with this is the grossest of everything what we start out with dead horse hooves i mean uh uh you know the the canneries you know and stuff you know the people that that kill the horses for meat and stuff you know they have all these le and stuff and i dont know everybody uh i thought they used the the horsehooves in for gelatin thats not so you know i think they do i think a lot of times but then they they probably use em for everything i dont know what all they use em for but anyway we get these horse hooves from this one cannery they they have to go a long ways to go get em like back east somewhere to get these horse hooves for the college they go back uh east and they get em and they freeze em you know so we have this frozen horse hoof that we have to start out on cause you dont want to cripple up a really good horse and like my first hoof that horse would have been lame like cra but it was just and oh god its so gross because sometimes if you get one thats been thawed out a little bit they start really stinking and stuff oh its the grossest thing oh its just so icky i mean you have this piece of horse i mean this leg thats oh its just gross and like in some of em blood will spurt out you know and i mean oh its nothing sm its the grossest thing sm and thats why thats probably why they have to make that class mandatory because at the beginning of the year its just the its the pits but once you get into it its the funnest thing and you know its really interesting to do stuff like tha but i would have never got into that class if theres no way if i didnt have to have it theres no way i mean i heard everybody saying um you know like the people that took the class before talking about oh you have to do this you have to do that theres dead horse hooves you know you gotta and they stink and all this other stuff and i was just going oh my g im never i dont want to take that class so maybe ill wait till next year and then i thought no ill get it out of the way now and then once i got into it geez i wanna take the second half of it it was just really interesting to me you know but at first it was kind of a bummer but im glad i took it really glad it pays off especially uh_you know twelve bucks for a trim i mean thats twelve bucks every time i can go out and trim my own horses hooves right you know and i wouldnt trust myself to do it with a horse that i was really using a lot or anything but the ones that are standing around thats still twelve dollars you know i mean whether the horse being used a lot or not thats twelve bucks and shoot i can do those you know but i always have anybody i always have somebody that really knows what theyre doing for the horses that im really really using but anyway i wanna wait until the morning to do that because its just too hot in the afternoon to try to sit out there i mean you can get just exhausted anyway i was gonna tell you about that uh the girl you know there isnt mary very many ferrier girl you know and her heart that do this this summer i met one jorgensens they have one shoer that comes to their house all the time theyve had him for years and years and years and i guess like in minnesota its real we and stuff you know so like they really have to watch their shoes for not coming off because the hoof wall is so much softer its like when youre down there your hands are softer and everything you know and theyre not as dry or anything when you get back here we have dry hooves we have to watch out for like uh like the hooves being too dry we have to put ointment on em and stuff the back there theyre too we not this time of the year because you know theyve had a dry year but usually theyre too wet and that that shoe can just pull righ o because its just the hoof wall is so soft yeah it seems weird that thats like that x you know and i nei i never knew that until i took this class either i didnt realize that in you know if you think about it yeah if it rains a lot the horse is always we and its always moist and its always on something moi yeah sure its gonna be softer but i never even thought about that until i took this class so its you know thats kinda stuff too that you think about but anyway they always have this one horseshoer and this girls been in this f uh shes going to an actual ferrier college they have a lo of those around a lo and shes going to one of em and shes been going for like nine months to this one and shes still got a lot more where is the uh left to go what where is the xx oh right here guess ill put it o its not on xx but anyway she ha um she hes like taking her as a uh you know hel her ou and stuff you know for the summer shes been working with him all summer and its really different to see a girl doing it you know you just uh dont see that at all ever jorgensens have a g or a g you know a guy theyve had a guy being a horseshoer for a long time you know and they are um theres this girl thats working with him for the summer unhunh and shes gonna be a ferrier yeah i couldnt believe it and shes just little shes a tiny girl but boy i tell you shes got ar the size of theyre hu but she must only what is m blowing out of there well thats what happens with that air conditioner its just it gets dust accumulated in it see its all over the tv it was just o last night how does it get du in it already we i it mae lynne for one thing the filters are dirty because it it so been so dry and the it all comes acrost the road you know and and then it builds up real bad with deposits out of the water oh in other words i should be change filters ugh go i know it wont last long but it sure does make a mess in the house yeah it makes a mess i need new filters xx anyway this girl must only weigh like a hundred and ten pou i mean shes just a little shit and shes out there and shes got hu arms i mean shes in shape like you cant believe shes out there just working away and those guys are so u to it that they do it all day long you know m and that doesnt bother em a bit to just go out there and trim and trim and trim and shoe and everything but for me thats something im not used to and boy i tell you you just sweat just ro off of you i just its tiring the very uh at the very beginning when we first started doing it we only did like one hoof then we moved up to two then we moved up to a full horse you know and we were just slowly got in shape doing that you know but now if i went to do that ho smokes id never be able to handle it why its just its a its har wor it is really hard work youre bent o and its uh you know it takes like i dont know why you sweat so bad doing it either but you jus oh its just its just har hard work its it doesnt seem like it would be but it is its really takes a lot of muscles to do it too i mean a lo those its hard you dont get kicked a lot ive never been kicked ever but like it those college h is course you know like i was talking our horses are a little better than most peoples horse cause theyve been arou people a lo and they they dont get by with stuff i mean we do get mad at our horses for you know whatever they do wrong we do get mad at em like i noticed horses at college they just havent been disciplined enough and theyre just its like a kid theyre just are ornery you know and like theyll move arou and uh kinda be ornery about half way but not not too bad ive never been kicked doing it at all and thats another thing we had to learn in the class you know just had to learn our safety of where to stand and how to stand you have to stand like these certain ways and oh and its a killer on your back cause youre standing like this oh im sorry berry youre standing whoops youre standing like thi you know and like when youre in the back the horses hoof uh_lays like this right over you and youre like this working you know this is like a hoof knife then a you know so youre always bent over youre always bent over and like in the front you stick the horses hoof between your leg you know kinda like that and you kinda you go like this you kinda bend down like this and you have the horses hoof right here its hard on your back its really hard on your back like i noticed that girls back muscles were just tremendous too you know couldnt believe it she had like on this really p kinda short shirt you know theres this i think thats cold just dont its if you rub something against it its just makes a sound nka so what what were you gonna do out there today what other what other things were you gonna just go out and um look at the filly yeah i think more or less its getting about so late now pretty much all were gonna do is go out i dont know what her plans really are but i think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then maybe go to that seasonal dance or whatever it is is that what its called i dont know i dont know what its called either you know he said there was four guy doing that doing what uh the dance you know how he said theres four guys i wonder if that means like since theres four seasons you know i wonder if that has something to do with it unhunh since he called it a seasonal dance xx hes a pretty neat guy i thought yeah he spoke crow okay i got a kick out of him when he kept saying it see this little cat little cat i dont wanna see the little cat i know i know that sounds like kit that sounds like kit i dont wanna say kitten that sounds stupid so she named everybody in the class except for about four people well i think they asked for names oh did they hunh thats funny look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there yeah i noticed on the on the case for the tape recorder too that its all that its all covered today look right here look at your cig even look right here just gee just from sitting here for just a minute thats look at the cigarettes its like a is it from that must be from the fi or what you know maybe it i maybe it i uh cause that one uh whole day you couldnt even see or anything from but look at your cigarettes just sitting there oh yeah on the way into r from roundup yesterday morning the radio was on and they were talking about the weather and they said how we everybody woke up with ash all over their car today and in roundup on the way from roundup i was listening to the radio yesterday morning and they were talking and so this was probably like a billings radio station or something like that yeah unhunh is that ri and they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today and i guess just from the fires yeah it is i was telling mae lynne hunh uh day before yesterday it was the most weird day ive ever seen in my entire adult l it was um the wind was blowing real hot when i first got up and it was early real early like seven oclock in the morning that that wind was just hot and n thing you knew it was just overcast well the smoke all blew in just like there was a fire right around close and it was just dense you couldnt even hardly see very far away okay then it that s it just kinda blew the smoke in and then blew it out but then it was real hazy and there was just dust particles all over and it was youd look at the sun and it would just look red i mean you couldnt see the sun it was just she said people were driving around with their lights on yeah and the lights were they didnt look like they were its just from the drought and the dust you know and the smoke in the air ive never seen anything like it and she said like the lights looked a greenish color yeah they look a green xxxx you know how they look yellow at night you know yeah they just looked green it was a wei ugly ugly day rana lees gonna have a baby by the way who is rana lee brians wife brians wife i didnt even know she was pregnant three months ago of course i guess they can get big in three months well i i told you too whats her name bran whats her name rana lee rana lee unhunh rana lee hm i dont know why i told you that rana lee she had a brother that died from asthma too seem like a lot of people i mean thats weird that i would know two people that died from asthma you know why dont we go just in except just in a matter of a years time this washing is xxx really yeah her brother was like just right out of high school i mean you know did mom tell you about deb at all she probably really couldnt since genetta was there you know she was like she was in the hospital in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff ever since she was little she was in and out of the hospital who was that debby debby i mean she was in x she loved horses so mu xxxx stuff on it and she was always like shes allergic to horsehair horse sweat oh x you know stuff like that but she wouldnt quit riding em so well xx shes allergic to everything it doesnt matter xxx was saying it didnt matter what she di did she ever go to a allergy doctor xxxx or anybody like that oh yeah she t well they she never did take shots did she no i dont know why they shouldve they should have gotten her i dont know why they didnt either i uh i w always wondered about that and she was s she had such severe asthma that i would have done a little bit more for her i think if you wanna talk about somebody tired that girl that girl couldnt walk down to the street and back without taking a nap and me and mom always accused her of being lazy you know because she was just all she did was sleep she sounded like she had more problems than and now that when we think about it she probably wasnt really lazy shes probably just exhausted i mean you know if you think about it we like take everything for granted we take our air for granted you know then somebody like that every little breath is like and effort to em d and you know and if i had to go through an effort just in breathing all the time well deb got i would be tired too debby got to the point where all she would do is when she did you know every just really often she would go to try to get enough air in and her they had an autopsy done on her and her heart was just hard on one side from labored breathing all of her life it had just labored her heart so bad she actually died of a heart attack she did yeah they did have an autopsy done on her yes it surprised me but they they did and it was actually a and her heart was ha cardiac arrest mhm one side of her heart was just hard from the muscle the muscle was just hard from just labored breathing gee trying to breathe all the time thats just sick yeah we thought she was just lazy and kind of worthless but we didnt realize what she was going through and you know maybe thats another reason why she didnt really maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff and maybe thats why she didnt really pay that much attention to amanda i mean no because i mean it seems like shed pay more attention to her but maybe its because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too and knew it wasnt gonna last forever for her you know i mean i guess like right before she died and stuff shes like telling her mom like well if i go i want this here and i want that there and you know just little things is amanda her kid or yeah oh she had a little threeyearold daughter its just too bad i just hope orville and genetta get that little girl oh they wont theres no are they even trying they cant they want her three months out of the year but they have no legal grounds i mean you know he is the legal father and theres not much they can do oh she was divorced mhm yeah and he is such a weirdo thi is the type of person that is like a hermit i dont know what youd call him well they were rai raised backward hes like uh back woods back woodsy raised in the mountains didnt d never came down out of the mountains he doesnt have any he doesnt know whats going on in this wo no he doesnt he was just not properly brought up he i mean he wouldnt even have the slightest idea xx where was he from u i forget idaho idaho and up in the mountains in idaho xxx um macley and arco isnt that where deb kinda was but hes just really really really strange how can you teach a threeyearold to ta dance i cant imagine teaching a yeah really who suggested this to em i have no idea it was probably my sisterinlaws idea because i think they saw that movie tap x x what was the they had the movie with that really hot tap danc oh that ki he was actually here two weeks ago and i missed him at the at the ja t thing or whatever was he a little kid no hes sixteen now no hes like yeah hes a teenager but he teaches these classes in new york that boy hes supposed to be awe yeah really fa hm but im sure that was the the impetus have you seen him no i just read an article on him you you probably read the same examiner article i read yeah probably yeah talking about how gregory hines said he doesnt realize a human being cant tap that fa right right yeah and they were talking about how hes teaching these cla hm and i guess he really goes fa and yeah he k he does explain anything precisely he has to double it dow to like o f speed or something before they can g pick it up well im sure thomas is all over it prob xx xxx i mean he has a bro xxxx could have see him i guess that means his broken leg is doing okay i was wonder about that i was imagining he had broke an arm or something oh yeah but it was his leg yeah thats like i guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff right he healed very quickly guess kids bo just like grow back really fast m yeah i think theyre really soft to start with theyre made of rubber th thats it thats why b little kids usually dont break their legs anyway cause theyre so x cause theyre made of rubber but they have more cartilage than w you know yeah arent they real s arent their k legs pretty soft yeah theres less calcium uh deposits in them and also mm theyre still growing and the way bones grow is you make cartilage and then you deposit calcium in it oh and then that turns into hard bone so thats why they always have more flexibility cause as theyre growing hm youre making cartilage so it al mhm they always have that until they reach adulthood in which case they get old and cranky like the rest of us it stops unhunh and then they break old and rickety and brittle mhm mhm uncoordinated and unflexible right stiff in that too what are you planning on doing with dancing harold you were taking some classes last fall ill take a few more as a you will it turns out as a spouse i get in free oh really so thats not bad to group classes yeah hm so i should do that oh really mhm thats why you married her some ben mm hunh mhm better than nothing oh i cannot be you said that what a jerk you are

parties across the street thats fun too and teenagers kissing each other on the side hm hm and little kids throwing p in your backya yeah and in the front yard you saw that x i saw that right in the front but well what is it paint it was the same color or something it was like or is it ch well i k i went out one morning and i saw it all around and it was like on the back bumper of the honda too

the the the really fat redhaired woman the mother the get over here you nya nya nya nya nya nya nya does she even have a b a man i guess she must does she have a what a ma a ma she has some kind of a at least temporarily yeah yeah at one time for about five minutes probably and they were banging their their soccer ball up against our below the bedroom th the study window so jamie the old lady went

running arou d in the street with his diapers on this butterball of a kid and then hed stop and go hed whee once he stopped running cause hes so fat that whenever he ru he gets really winded and hes you know a year and a half yea years old or two years old a year and a half old a year and a half years old uh theyre terrible really i cant t how do you she just looks pregnant now shes pregnant shes totally pregnant oh its not eating too much shes pregnant so i guess i mean thi this thi this just happened or were gonna have babies crying in the middle of the night well its no worse than her screaming at em is it yeah but now youll have both yeah right probably be like shut up you ki you know xx oh go i feel i s feel like such an old lady but i they just really annoy me kay hunh new subject hm well its cause they have no respect yeah i guess so those two top ma there yep we need a verb i guess the ones below are women is that why they look so different uhoh i mean i well you see their eyeballs i guess right yeah the other in addition to a mustache and a beard but the thing is that second one looks like the guy who was in one of the oba oba skits do you know those any of those dances all of em all of em the little what looks like th second why one from the top looks like a guy who was in the oba oba k skit whats an oba oba skit oba o oh the brazilian troop that was here dancing yeah oh yeah i never saw that look like uhuh a real an actual person doing it or some kind of masks they had or no uh the guy looked like that or theres a guy looked like that yeah thats pretty good x just like him with the right i mean that looks kinda like a black person with red eyes and everything so where is this fro this isnt from africa is it no from indonesia uh but that person looks bla which one is it or do indonesian people look black looks pink to me the which one the i figure the second one from the to tumenggung the second from the top tumeng hunh i look at that and think yeah that looks like a brother thats interesting cause i think indo indonesians think or people whove been to indonesia think that those guys like the two top ones have really european characteristics compared to indonesians uh just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big their eyes are rou oh really and indonesians have real thin eyes and and flat noses and stuff i dont know except those well i dont know the the bottom ones dont have flat noses either thats true they all have b they all have big noses but they get bigger as you go up anyway what do you think makes em look african their mustaches is it the uh the way their little beard goes oh no thats not even relevant i d i just glanc at that hunh and i immediate saw this guy face in oba oba yeah hunh thats inter he looks like that guy poor guy that is really interesting yeah bulging eyes cause i remember he came to bahia after one of his shows one night 's kinda funny wow well the top guy has a real thick lip oh in his black leather jacket and his black mm klana has a real thick lip hood hat right pretty bad over too hes in oba oba you know smoking he didnt yeah then he tried to he danced with a friend of mi yeah what happened but she didnt wanna dance with him anymore i said boy he just wanted to get close to me oo oo mm i said well cant blame him oba oba m_yeah gross mm but im sure those guys get a lot of attention from women they travel all over the world im sure a lot of women throw themselves at em so thats what they expe from women a lot of groupies yeah fringe benefits hm the only fringe benefit of being a dancer probably well in san francisco but then again you never know if its a benefit or not either that true i didnt know this but apparently in brazil they have a very very high ai infection rate really oh oh probably x its supposed to be ve high mm you mean like very unmonitored higher than the united state too higher than around here thats what ive heard hm i wouldnt be surprised have you heard these figures that like um its something like forty percent of males in the bay area are supposed to be infected well last ju oh really this is what of homosex males or of males of all males of males in general this infectious disease woman or males under thirty i think it is at san francisco general mhm she said that this doesnt seem like it can be true but she said that ninety per cent of gay men are hiv positive and fifty percent of a males are hiv positive yeah thats what she said fifty perc it was some like a m half or more than half of and it was fairly young men but were had been exposed to hiv virus it wasnt necessarily that they were infected well if youre hiv positive its the same difference mhm since they feel that sooner or later youll come down with the actual disease mhm yeah but thats what she sai now i dont know if she meant the bay area or san francisco x but those are some ferocious numbers if one out of yeah thats just horrible two guy you meet yeah cause therere a lot of women out there who apparently dont believe in using condoms hm im just ama xx dumb mo see id heard that it was main really dumb in ts mainly urban areas yeah that had this really disproportionately high propor um percentage and then like r rural areas or like you know central iowa and stuff had like ten percent or less of the males had been infected well i would assume san francisco is higher than most cities around the country unhunh mhm but that just blew me away cause im thinking well gee if half of all the me are hiv positive what does that mean about the women theyre having sex with right yeah well but and just talking with guy x xx in their twenties why i mean these guy say these women dont care if they use rubbers or not this is what guy have been telling me you know and im thinking i i cant believe that cause in this city with all the information available it seems like right yeah stupid people people have the information they need it is just amazing that people in their twenties apparently a right thats really scary so i guess its time for me to become a priest its too dangerous out there oh i dont know i couldnt believe it this woman i knew i was gonna ask out go you have to be catholic first her sister whos an hiv counselor was telling me how her sister just wont use rubbers at a hm well where would she put them and im thinking im thinking well how can you not my sisters dont i mean uh what are they thinking i dont know dont look at me uh i i was just really amazed to hear that people in their twenties were innocent cause i figure we dont have sex growing up around here you would know better and in high school you know they teach about it mhm so i dont know not only that but they have really lewd billboards all over the castro district somethings wrong i know i thought we got our electricity fixed thats kind of scary i thought i turned this o though its been doing didnt i oh thats right but you did thats really scary then this is salsa right yeah what what who is this i dont know its from the radio station years ago when i was in santa cruz you know on sunday at ten oclo thats right now kay what is that k oh i dont know what the radio station is they play salsa it begins with a kay though no they played th they have a brazilian ja hour is there a kksf i dont know what it was but it was like i went to bahia whats last sunday got there at eight left a te dropped this person off at home in foster city and came back and i x was noticing the songs they were playing on the radio were the exact same so they were singing at bahia the b live band there hm should i turn on the radio statio you dont know what station it was on i i was kksf does that mean anything to you nope you have to translate it to a number i was in a rental car so it was just whatever station it was on mm hm but uh i was just remembering being surpri cause i didnt realize i dont know anything about brazilian music you go to the brazilian club and theyre singing songs apparently i guess thats the popular stuff i guess im so used to hearing those songs cause ive heard em for the past three months i didnt think anything of it but then this guy played songs for a whole hour and it was like eighty per cent of those songs id that band had sung that very ni mhm pickup bands pretty good there vi well they have a different band every night who was it viva brazil oh i went on the x friday night so maybe it was different band um when did you do that oh a while ago the dance floors too small in that place though its really annoying i like this song are they teaching any more lambada at uh school yeah vivian was giving a lambada lesson cause uh when i was there the other day well my lambadas definitely getting better really really i wanna go out lambada dancing with you xx i mean im gonna start dancing with those brazilian women so i can learn how to beat my hips i mean cause their their hips are beating up against you you know like that fa x hundred cycles per second or something i mean i am not kidding it it is a different sensation entirely when youre dancing with the i bet and the uh only way to learn how is to dance with them mo thats true but i feel like i can start dancing with them now but uh no th i dont i dont they havent done anything recently i i cant remember if theyre going to cause like sue swing taught that class for two mo may and ju and uh is she a good lambada dancer i cant imagine her being a yeah but i didnt feel like she taught it any different significantly differently than when vivian and jeff taught it i mean cause they do it real basic and real simple d than brazilians do it yeah i mean i dont know what those brazilian women are doing what are they do but their hi are like are they going are they going like really fa i mean are they going one two three i mean one two three first you had this wi sw of their hips this way and the its like theyre coming i mean theyre beating me like this i dont even know how you can do that youre dancing with them theyre beating you just like this using their hands like that no using thei pelvic bones wo mm right here yeah sort of like tahitian dancers or some yeah you know close but i tell you but anyway you know they werent teaching it that way x x you know the ballroom people dont do it that way xx xx but thats what i want to learn dont dont they teach dont they teach you to go one two three one two three one two three like that or do they go like really fast like that well sue swing i mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate and the same thing with jeff and vivian viv yeah it was just jeff and sure but thats cause its for s its for people who cant move their hips right i mean its for basic you know this is a beginning lambada class or intermediate xxxxx i dont know why they did it that way i mean it seems to me if theyre gonna teach it like what you do uh or what they teach and what happens socially could be two different things you know i mean brazilians definitely dont hm do it like that i should i want to go i should check it out i like that cause its fun x x i mean after i f i mean i are you do they still teach at bahia on sunday night oh yeah in fact i would have gone today if it wasnt for my back well i finally found some people there i can da with so that helps do you need a partner to go there yeah no besides you i mean if youre a guy if if youre a woman i mean those guysll be all over you i swear it dont say that run along now harolds in the room dear you could come too well i dont necess mea uh in a bad way even though im sure there are a few there uh uh im not dancing with guys all i can say is the women arent all over me da oo but but i remember like i went there with this person its kind of funny th this person did not want to dance so shes just gonna watch so every once in a while id get up and dance and its like when id come ba i mean there was some guy there sitting in my chair every time i got up im thinking go these guys dont waste any ti i mean you turn your back and theres somebody moving in i mean i dont know if they x x maybe harold you should come with me why so i can find learn some lam lambada find some girls with empty chairs next to em maybe i should go with miles oh did uh yeah you guys could be partners did what well i dont know if i told you uh told you that story about that woman who uh went after that guy there i told you that story right i was there sunday three four weeks ago uh after the class is over w over with im sitting down at a table theres a woman from who was in the class and two men sitting to my right is a table with two women there they had apparently just come from oba oba on the la night oh i think you told me the last night yeah and like well they were attractive women the one had on a real real short skirt anyway there was this guy in his fifties out there dancing by himself and the woman was just looking at him making eyes then she went out there got on her knee in front of him in this skirt thats this short takes her hands and goes along his toes and then up and is just d like that i figured oo oh they must know each other oo very well in fact mhm gro thats what i assu and they did that for the whole dance and i mean she was d all kind of suggestive stuff and touching him and everything people would like cheering and clapping go for it and all this kind of thing the the song ended the guy set dow at another table and she set dow at a at the table with her woman friend they never danced again the rest of the even hm this is like so i was thinking this womans sitting about as far away from me as jamie is and i was thinking hm this is interesting i wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her no sooner did i think this thought guys were over there what you didnt ask her to da not miles hes just in daze well i was still trying to figure out surely they must know each other i mean why wasnt he sitting at her table you mean you were thinking about it anyway this guy uh uh i mean he comes over there immediately afterwards the same guy who got his the same guy whos no its just some random guy or just some random guy no a random guy who was like sitting about where you are yeah he was sitting there there were two guy sitting at a table right where you are and then these two women are sitting here so uh he comes over there and is talking with that woman i dont know about what but then like ten minutes later she and her friend are over at their table and then twenty minutes later they were kinda like all over each other you know kissing et cetera et cetera and i was thinking it looks like these people arent going home alone tonight go but i just thought that no wonder they forbid this dance so oh my god what a story well maybe i shouldnt go there then yeah maybe you shouldnt it it it was interesting no i went there before it was fine it was really fun you were the before yeah i went out there before oh without even telling harold without telling me uhuh you knew if i was going out dancing oh oh i did remember a few months ago i used to go out dancing every now and then hmm i dont remember well the thing that gets me i meet this to caesars and stuff i meet this psychotherapist who tells me shes addicted to this dance which i th think is a interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use but uh shes marrie and apparently shes there without her husband she has her wedding ring on and its like shes with this guy and theyre kinda like all over each other and im thinking we i guess thats her husband uhoh did you say something but i but i was thinking but the thing is you know shes kind of all sophisticated and everything and im thinking you know this guy uh uh i cant really believe that guys her husband so i dont know whats going on here and of course later on i find out thats not her husband so im thinking you know i dont know whats going on here but uh uh bizarre gossip but then she tells me gee i dont know what it is about this guy i mean ive been trying to tell him i dont want a sexual relationship with him and im thinking from the way they look when id seen them three weeks before it looked to me like they ha one im thinking you dont do that with so this is all at bahia strangers all this stuff happens at bahia yeah hunh to other people i mean we x i mean maybe that was actually very profou yeah that was maybe you can just go up to a woman and you know do that kinda thing yeah you you wind up getting punched mhm is whatll happen probably somethingll land in your mouth well it sounds like there you wouldnt be though what yeah right i really was wondering what that guy was thinking he must have been j since he didnt know her that must have been quite a shock that was really wei that sounds really weird i mean youre y y

oh i think it theyre great do you have a salad spinner no theyre cool is this like something you had when you were young in your own family no its brand new oh shit yeah i dont think they ever did

climbing expedition was that xx the one that we were part of the ex we went on in nepal oh that in nepal unhunh um what was the problem was supposed to be supposed to be perfect weather right in between the yeah perfect weather and all that stuff unhunh and they ended up getting early winter storms or late monsoon storms or whatever yeah whatever and thats it was a weather mhm you know everywhere weve been in the past several years everybodys talking about how the weather just isnt normal thats true thats definitely been the case in indonesia for quite a few years mhm really really yeah well like when i was living there for the couple of years it was the rainy season was all off you know it rained during the dry season and was dry during the rainy season oh really and stuff like that yeah gee and really really dry they were having a drought while i was there yeah i dont know i mean i i dont know if our drought here will ever break i wonder if this is just isnt this is it hm the new weather for southern california well they they claim that theres these cycles and that were in the the middle of a normal cycle i dont know how true that is well thanks i r i really we read this great book called the end of nature ew sounds wonderful by this guy this um you know bill mckibben twentyeightyearold harvard guy right who lives out in the woods a la thor mhm anyway smart and uh its called yeah its called the end of nature and its just really a scary book you know theres no natural world left right all the natural world was go in nineteen seventyfive his premise is basic this and now xxx that um as soo as the world hit a point where there was no more objectively pristine land unhunh when you know they found pollution on top of mount everest right mhm and at the very bottom of the ocean right well thats it mhm man has had some effect on the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe right so in principle the concept of nature as a system inside of which man lives is over mhm right and then in practice since then which was fifteen years ago mhm man has had such dramatic impact on what we used to think of as nature that that the only way to coexist with nature its no longer nature the quasi religious overarching ordering principle right in of which mankind lives wordsworthian nature m and uh you know w a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force over and above ourselves to order the universe forget all that mhm woo thats spi its now shit you know the world is gonna be kept in order by the same people that brought you you know the atomic bomb right and all that stuff right right which just doesnt sound like a very practical proposal yeah wow you know the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in europe and america x and the dodo are now en with main whats there xx the rest of the natural world maintaining the en globe for the rest of time mhm right not likely mhm so that was his basic premise and then he goes on for the rest of book to absolutely then it gets really depressing heartless oh good oh gee heartlessly debunk you havent heard nothing yet all of the you know wateryeyed new age uh various theories of gaia and all that stuff of how it might not be that way right you know so unhunh forget it forget it forget it right were fucked mhm well i read it in the new yorker and i thought oh no one of those new yorker articles you know yuck right and i it was really i read the whole thing which is pretty rare well my my so i mean but his premise is not that mankind cant survive on earth right his ques is its just its a whole different earth can man spiritually survive right in a metaphysical world in which it is patently obvious that man is the highest active principle mhm you know outside of compl faithbased belief in god you know which is uh irrespective of any relationship to nature mhm there is now absolutely nothing in the world to which we are beholden and he w his question was what impact is this gonna have on the sort of fucks up the animists cultural growth right of of the human species mhm do we even want this right do we want to be the guy in charge of the world unhunh on the other hand isnt he saying its too late well he is kind of saying its too late so this is why its such a depressing book right hes saying we already did it and we havent even thought about so much for culture whether we wanted to do it or not right this is typical yeah you know and and then it gets down to s you know i mean that brings into play other peoples remarks like you know the w its all fine and good for us in this ge lets cook those xx so like to talk about saving the wha rinse them or something wash them yeah did wash them did you want them broken smaller or oh i think theyre good like that okay are they good thats good alright yeah yeah you know saving the whale or saving uh the polar bea ri pandas or making sure theres enough grizzly bears thats fine mhm but but implicit is that at any point in time anytime in the future that m the collective you know group mhm or even individual special interests decide yeah fuck the whales right theyre out of there bango mhm and so a interesting book i read it because of this project you know which project the ani kingdom project oh okay i dont think i know about that project its a thing im doing for disney so is that why you went to africa yeah such a scum so hes going back to um so he nepal and india too when november make me x x those are not all related languages no they arent what they they just all happen to be in southeast asia oh thats why ilocanos in the philippines right right i have a neat book i dont know if youve seen whats cebuano its in the philippines too its on the island of cebu oh of course figure that one out no i cant its a department store in tokyo um x a book called xx power and gold power and gold power and gold its all about xx moslems jewel traditions hm unhunh of the archipelago of indonesia and the philippines right oh that sounds great do you wanna see it yeah it was at the la county xxx ill be back oh it was like this the an exhibi an exhi thing oh its right here oh that sounds great mhm it was neat did you you did you oh no you never went to jakarta no okay cause theres in the national jakarta no in the national museum they have a gold room that has all this gold stuff oh god its really neat you mean not made out of gold just no oh i mean its this x its called the gold room well arent you neat look at those little ends all wrapped up in that plas bag well x or do you like should they go somewhere where they they recycle or turn in compost um or we dont have a com pile yet so it just goes in the trash like this thats part of my which is where landscape thing garbage is underneath if you can save the bag you can turn it inside out and save it oh okay its okay but you dont have to this is this is theres already plastic bags in there so yeah ill put these on the dining room table theres already a xxx just oh anyway mm hey that carrots good its got its really pretty well thats good it goes island to is system by island system are we ready to eat should i

theories drawing at least art histor parall what am i doing between motifs of the should steam these peop of a xxx unhunh uh with with mostly batak and dayak and oh really stuff yeah oh thats interesting and actually when you see it un when you see them right you can imagine pretty clearly unhunh some connection anyway interesting hunh yeah that looks like enough salad oh i get it mar went out to put the you put the water on the plants is that what was going on what you were watering with that is that what you were doing yeah yeah thats good perfect water unhunh actually you know id love to do gray water mhm here but its illegal its illegal really how rude isnt that retarded isnt that weird it is they just built a a great big gray water processing center at the laundromat in the complex where i live oh its like right outside our back door theres all these huge machines and stuff great m that like filter it and all and then it theyre going to like pump it into their watering system for the apartment complex gray water systems are local to i mean you get your own you don its not like a big system some right yeah you get your own gray water system right yeah yeah but this is like but its a complex right cause this is this apartment complex and theres the laundromat and they just dump the water from that and everything well laundrys the best way and showers i guess the best way to get gray water right well i would think you wouldnt want to think what might go down in the sink and stuff you wouldnt want to what well i guess i guess its more that its not that you dont want it on your lawn its that you dont want it sitting around before it goes on your lawn right right stuff from the sink yeah cause the stuff from the sink would be great for your lawn if it could get right out there right yeah but then it would be sitting there sort of decomposing or doing its thing all over the lawn instead of in a nice little compost pile yeah so thats well mm well not if you were care i mean you know if you if you if you didnt have if you were really careful about your dishes right and scraped em off yeah and it was just x runoff mhm yeah well that would be good cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with but yeah actually you know zeke the sheik is a local you know the guy whose compost pile blew up oh no i dont know a this didnt you hear about him no it it caught fi here finish these up it caught fire and um he he used the compost from the um place next door that was a big big big cemetery and here you wanna butter these the grass clip mhm a huge ceme yeah they would mow their lawns yeah he would take the grass clippings and he asked em if he could have the grass clippings for like fifteen years mhm so he had this how many just make three of em m is that whats happening or however long the butter lasts xx xxx um so he had and and it blew up a forty foot tall compost pile unhunh and it started to combust you know internally right just sort of naturally just like dickens mhm spontaneously yeah ah now what am i doing with this so just like this butter them its al open yeah okay yeah and split em okay you didnt even split em presplit yeah those are left over theyre probably yeah there might be mold i think theyre okay oh fine mm mm delicious mm nutty sesame or what is this sourdough poppy seed are they no is the mold oh yeah oh oh n ho are the bean sour how are the beans x great y is thi like deli uh checking for an expiration date no i was just wondering what all the what all the black things were in it mold oh right shall i do something civilized like clear the ta or are we just gonna barbarian it out no why dont you clear the table unless we want to eat outside its dark how will we see what were eating candles xxx you wanna eat inside or outside pete i dont care outsides fine lets eat outside ju but you still have to clean off that table cause its grody which table this table here no the table out i

turns bright red she she does well she would if you know if her skin werent like really dark brown shed probably be bright red how funny man you know you you cant really tell when they blush its very unusual but um her mom like it was a horrible situation where last week i wasnt there on thursday cause i had to fill out all this stupid n n you know i had to do all this shit just in order to get my position secured there with the bureaucracy so they let me off for a day and there was a sub and what annalisa claims and her mother claims is that on that day they brought back the application for free lunch all filled out and that the s took it ah righ oh for goodness sake so uh you know i find this out a week later i kept bugging annalisa t you know did you bring the form in did you fill it all out why dont you get another one and i search my desk and its not there and i keep calling the office and sending notes and they keep calling me on the their stupid in system that you can hardly understand x mm you have to tell students never get give a tutor anything anything ever not even homework they wouldnt let us give homework to the high school tut i know because they just they lose it they dont care yeah well they they dont give a shit about anything i know i i i hadnt thought of that at th at that point last week let me out of here un theyve just begun subbing well this woman because th theyre like what are we gonna learn today see im originally a pe teacher but i guess i can teach math you know they come in with that attitude and they go ive always wanted to teach math now what are we on its gonna be great you know and youre saying uh were on uh square root of pi uh and they look at you and they go the what so they dont know what the hell theyre doing uh pi why dont we go out and run some laps i didnt bring any pie with me today you know they they dont know what theyre doing i dont think we can have pie till lunch kids yeah s its like distorted they dont know what theyre do well this lady is apparently an ol sub who like all the teachers know and apparently shes very reliable ah so whether the paper got in or not i dont know but um you cant go and ask her well i k kept calling the office and saying do you have this form and theyd tell me no and i finally went in there on thursday and im like look where is it this kid you know she uh most of the time doesnt have money i have to give it to he myself you know she shes deprived of lunch do you can do you have a form for her they dont have extra lunch left over at the end of the day that they will give away w on file no you gotta go in and talk to the principal about this coop this is a raging bureaucracy and theres nothing that i can do i have found that out when you wait until you hear what th all theyve done with my class y just be disgusted but fourth gra this girl ugh um and so i go in there and im like well can you tell me whether the the form is on file cause i i n i realize it takes two to three weeks to process but just tell me whether its on file because if not i want her to have another one now and the womans like i cant do that theres a privacy code or whatever theres a privacy act and i cant acce the file li g what kind of fucking law is tha that youre gonna tell me that you know this kid might have to wait another month and a half to e have any lunch because you cant access you know her fo what the deal unbelievable theyre just giving i think it sounds like to me theyre giving you a lot of sh for no reason well they really are picking on the fact that im new like y uh its really annoying the fact that youre new uh uh that i i would i would go further than that im not certified an y its like the teachers an coop this last week cant first theyre like first i only had fifteen kids right and the legally you have to have eighteen hisd rules has it that you have to have at least eighteen right so im the only permanent sub im the only teacher whos not experienced whos not certified who just started teaching all these other teachers are old hands i mean theyve all been at it for at well chris is the least experienced besides me but still hes you know hes had his certification and hes had a year and stuff hes real good at it so they do shit like first they tell me like i find out accidentally from the other teachers the principal doesnt even tell me first she hires me n like the friday before school starts and expects me to get my room ready and then and then i find out on thursday in the first week of school that i might lose my jo yeah you told me come friday yeah and and then th so i come into class and theyve put like all these thirdgrade students in there did i tell you about that no its really annoying what theyve done to meet the l the they split it third and fourth little technicality that they have to meet yeah they just s the whole thing challenging yeah its well its something its twice as much work for you its something for experienced teachers its not for me you know its like really hard for me because you know uh and then you have to n and then thats what i was doing when i was student teaching i had split fifth sixth well they didnt even give me any texts coop i mean i was the only teacher in the whole school who did not have textbooks you know mhm because they were fucking me around so hard so then on the on friday i have eigh kids im like great you know and all these teachers are coming in and saying well my child is on your role but im gonna keep him in my class you know mm and i have these three thirdgraders you know but the shitty thing is that they pick what the teachers do is they go oh well this this kid is bad behaved i mean hes hes really stupid ill just send him over to the new instructor of course so they s so the are of course th kids that i receive are the three thirdgraders of the lowest e that nobody wants and the worst conduct right and so th meanwhile in the pri o theyre telling me sorry i just got a visual sharon standing in front of the class going aw sometimes im like that while these little kids kinda senorita fli hee hee hee hee hee oh miss fli miss fli mi fli you know towards the last couple of days im like i put up a list of rules and all day lo i went back to the rules do not pull on my clothes and they get up out of the chair and they come up to me miss flinn miss flinn and id walk over by the rules and id point to number two and id just look at them and they knew what number two was dont get out of your seat without permission you know so theyd look at me and theyd go go theyd go back to their chairs on the last day that i was there like it was so awful because boy youre a hard ass i had to be a hard ass the people w all the teachers were telling me could be worse youre too nice youre too nice your kids are gonna take advantage of you and they were th th k yeah they came to where theyd be talking the whole time during the as x ah id be up at the board theyd be id turn around theyd go ah hee hee hee cause they didnt think i was serious and i finally got to the point where uh you know every day id have em put their heads on the table for ten minutes hunh you know with the with their eyes closed time out quiet time and i finally got to where i withheld re and on the last day i kept th four kids after schoo yeah you know but you can only actually keep them over for like five minutes cause they have like buses to catch and stuff well im telling you withholding goodies works because theyll get kind of surly i did that but if you give them rewar well i gave them st i gave sticker you know to the k to the kids and i put e and i give stickers to the kids and the ones that got good gra that got one hundreds and ninetyeights and ninetysixes i put their papers up on the board well there are other things you can do besides um um you know you can make up goodies you dont have to spend money on goodies you can have like you can make these little um do they have a laminating machine in the school not in the school but in this other lovely place well make these little passes or something that say one one free lunch with the teacher or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime i get to sit with my friends at lunch or what think up whatever little privileges like that um if theres anything in the classroom that they really like to do have that be a privilege that n can do unless they have this pass and then give those p out for good behavior at the end of the day i have an idea choose the mister samuel way of teaching take them by the hair boom heads against each other or you can walk up to the chalkboard and you get really good so you go and you practice on the weekends get chalk from the chalkboard and you just peg it at their face you know i remember and you and you practice finally that man was fired man it took them how many years they fired him oh mister sam he k sh god he was the most man he threatened little kid wed all be sitting in a circle and itd be current events time wed all be sitt there he was harsh and one little kid eli goodman would just give him uh he was just talking eli was just talking mister samuel must have had a really bad day he came up alright you little shit im gonna throw you against this wall and he threatened it he threatened to throw the kid against the wall and we all heard it and we all went home and told your parents freaked out no because w we were too scared to do anything and we would and our parents would go oh hes a great guy and theyd go and visit him and he would put on the bullshit and hed be fine and no one believed the kids you know he was a man who would walk up to two little boys that were talking and grab their hair and actually bang their heads together what a guy he picked ken romig up once by the hair i remem th yeah xxx ken whos like was actually very wellbehaved you know and and really smart student went on to be one of those overachievers you know just yanked him up by his little bl hai by the hair yep we were all like oh but he wont do anything to the girls if they give him backrubs thats right thats righ mister samuel had like the most what a j man unethical classroom i can ever re he was a fool he was an absolute fool i remember the the students i remember muffin being terrified that she was going to be put in his class xx his daughter his daughter actually admitted it to me i saw sally samuel admitted what who is pregnant and has about you know lets not discuss it but i was like u what did she admit hows your father i was kind of crude but i was like so what is your f doing right now is the man d yet no x i was just very kind she goes well he he got fired and and i said oh re now thats a surpri que las and the guy that he threatened to throw against the wa was put forward a year eli graduated a year before i did see i didnt understand that it was a hush hush deal didnt make an sense it w it was really weird well hed like elis parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class his classroom was like and that was the on way to do it no doubt cra no doubt that man was insa definitely insa hey coop what i was gonna tell you about that really frustrates me is that uh that the people principal and stuff they say to me oh well what you do with those thirdgraders you know is you just like take them and put them you know with one of the smarter fourthgraders whos very ver uh and and wellbeha and you have them work as a team you know so that the fourthgrader can help the thirdgrader but thats bullshit because that just teaches the thirdgrader with the lesser intelligence that that hes worthless you know that he cant learn stuff on his own no its not no its not you ca put them in teams like that but you dont put one with one you put like two fourthgraders with how many thirdgraders do whats the r of third to fourthgraders but theyre not you mean so they dont feel singled out now i have like five thirdgraders or what i have like t twentytwo kids okay so you have fifteen fourthgraders and five thirdgraders na uh no i have like seventeen fourthgraders and five thirdgraders all you have is twel kids what you only have twelve kids no seventee oh okay fourthgraders so then what you do is you sprinkle the fifthgraders out evenly and you make the fourthgrader take the responsibility for teaching them thirdgraders and you engrain in them that its their responsibility to help those little kids thats what i did i have been but and it works can you can you say its part of your gra as long as its part of your yes oh yes corp or you bet what do you call it well the thirdgra you tell them that their ability to cooperate is being graded coop well the third are just like y theyre getting a grade in coopera you know except for a couple who who are real smart darn that would be so har feel like uh you know theyre incapable i mean th they just feel like xxx well the fourthgra try and lord it over em too and the fourthgraders will try to just like give them the answers theres nothing else you can do about it and its hard for me to keep track of that you know ill be like dont give them the answers standing over i want you to help them understand but dont just give them the answers it takes a lo time to teach em how to work together i if i cant teach these kids you know i go around to the thirdgraders i try to teach them individually what a noun is itll start to happen by january sharon i mean it takes a very long time its not easy to do im not gonna be there until jan have have you explained to them like the speech about making mistakes is part of life that speech a whats the other speech the other speech is ive given them ev u dont give away dont give away the answers because youre d denying them of learning mhm if y if you put it to them in a very s way and they get it and they kind of go yeah well what you want to do is when you have them in groups wor on something i have i have it shouldnt be multiple choice it shouldnt be it isnt something easy they should they should have to write it out have some discussion going on like give them something to work on that there is no answer to but the other fourthgraders its like that is just opinion theyll learn just as much you know they dont really wan they dont want to help the kids they they wa you know theyre done and they want to play and they get u with me if i expect them to help the thirdgrader xxx help em to learn the basics tough and they dont have the patience too bad this is the funny one or the psycholo yeah to l how to teach the kids well when youre subtracting you bring the one over and then that becomes ten and then you have to cross it out it becomes a nine go and then you bring the one o i couldnt do it you know i couldnt do it and these the thing is that the teachers that had these thirdgraders before and a lot of the fourthgraders really failed as teachers cause they didnt teach them didd jack they should have learned that in the second grade in the in the second grade i learned my times tables in the third grade i knew th fourth grade was i had them mem up until twelve fractions i failed these kids cant do their times table the fourthgraders even well theyve just you know theyve been i have one student you know who knows his times tables up until ten wait they uh hey the teachers have just been passing them along xxx wait a minute neither did i yeah i didnt know them either i didnt know times tables till s like fifth gra only cause i was a dufus but well were no it was because you were a lazy butt i could not i could not do fractions i could not do fractions and i mean with samuel as a teacher who wants to tell them who wants to go up to this man and say i have a problem you didnt really have mister samuel did you oh hell yeah oh i thought you got out of being in his cla unh i had him my whole fourthgrade year and then there was a possibility the following year that he was going to teach fifth gra cause our fifthgrade tea was leaving so all of us were like shitting in our pants going no plea no we just we lucked out man but we got missis l who was like the first granola woman i ever met granola wo she would say lets go on a field trip were gonna go on a hike but but to try and and talk me out of believing in murphys law by offering a miracle as a replacement that doesnt d work well youre right i think theyre probably flip sides i mean who are you but im pollyanna ha hardly look where ive come from i mean uh uh this chapter on heaven an hell its really interesting why i used to have this sort of uh standard li that uh there were two things i got out of my marriage one was a name that was easy to spell and one was a uh a child uh that really got me grounded but the fact of the matter is that the marriage itself i mean as h as it was uh its like it pulled me under like a giant octopus or a giant uh giant shark and it pulled me all the way under and then and there i was it was like the silent scream and then then i found that i was on my own two feet again and it r was uh uh s what was hell in that that marriage became became a way out for me it was the flip side its like sometimes you go through things and you come out the other side of them you come out so much better and if i hadnt had that if i hadnt had its not the way with food what do you mean what goes in one way doesnt come out xxx kay comes out very hellish yeah very hellish so what did that have to d but its so good k so good going down th i mean what did theres theres the opposites again its its ma the food is like all unique hey and wonderful i its majorleague yin and yang and heavenly major league what does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book well uh im just sort of reiterating i could read you some no i mean is that allowed no i i dont want to hear anything out of a book with chapter called heaven and hell you dont no nkay well then lets talk about our vacation im gonna be closedminded about it oh dear but thats hell i didnt like the book the way i the minute i looked at it you didnt no thats cause you thats because i have my own ideas about it i guess that im pretty comfortable with ah i dont like re i dont like reading books about what other people think about dying and i consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff well and thats remember remember it in the movie in beetlejuice the h for the recently deceased yeah i mean books wor i mean n they just become handbooks you distill them and use them in your own way no no no i dont i dont i i come up with my own ideas about that stuff and where do you get the ideas thought and where do you get those thoughts processing what goes on around me well isnt a book part of what goes on around you well uh uh more from an oblique sou you know when youre reading fiction or or articles or history or something like that but but t for me its very difficult to pick up a b about d that someones written about death because its bullshit well who knows what death is what d what what this man has put in the boo you havent read the book one you havent read the book so you dont know i havent read the book so i dont know yeah but i do know it its an awfully its its an awfully presumptuous thing but to sit down and write a book about death d when you havent died it has it has it has stories in there from from the zen an f it just pools on other different wel the zen can be bullshit too uh different sources i mean whoever wrote the book of zen wasnt dead either well it might all be bullshit but you g you g youve gotta pull these ideas from your environment and whats gone on before th th the things i know most about life and death come from from my g and having gone through all that uh with her and then it was interesting cause reading i did after that substantiated that experience for two months prior to her death did i tell you this that she dreamt about um she had this dream of falling off a building down o just like that that cartoon we saw falling yeah the animation cartoon yeah yeah yeah and it was like that and thats what she was dreaming about and then she said that she dreamt about u all of her relatives that had died she wasnt dreaming about anybody who was living but who had die and i read that l you know it was much later i read that in a book where u people who had uh technically died and then have been revived saw relatives coming for them ive read that course that may be what happens prior to the big the big nothing so why are you reading a book about dying i dont know you dont know i have an interest in it why youre alive why are you r a book about dying ive always been interested in it uh why i mean you know y ask someone why theyre interested in electronics and they can probably tell you well i dont know i guess it must fo some reason i was fascinated with that movie last night with with uh lilian gish and b and bette davis i couldnt believe these two old i dont know i wanna say windba ha but what h to them i heres betty davis i mean sa z yeah this incredible film legend and we think of her in jezebe we think of her you know smoking cigarette smoke into the faces of william holden and and the like i dont ive never seen those movies youve never seen betty davis movie youve heard kim uh the song betty davis eye sure and shes got she got the womans got a re and so she she lives and yeah i guess its j looking at my mother too i n uh what does that have to do with why youre reading a book on death ive always been interested in death why why yeah im laughing what is im thinking one thing my mother always used to say when i wouldnt go bicycling with my father pamela you are she would say you are she would say youll be s when were dead because you would bicycling mm because i wouldnt go bicycling with my father oh so i w its its you know and i h i bit my tongue the other day because remember you said to deven well i really want to spend time with you yeah and then we went to the chalk fair and then he took off with tobias the chop fair the chalk oh the chalk fair unhunh and he took off with tobias yeah is that that that i wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today and why did you run off and i didnt because i remembered that my mother tried to guilt me the same way so thats why youre interested in death maybe its because my parents were ol when i was young very very young ive always thought its w that weve been i look down at my body and i f like im in a spaceship yeah i just thats why youre interested in death n and i just think its so damn weird were here yeah yeah well it i and and i was constructed inside of some w w and i was burped out so so youre running youre running down the road all the way to the very end hunh n youre youre youre already standing at the end of the road trying to figure out what hap there uh well uh n n maybe i maybe im just eager to get back to where i wa may back into the womb uh no no no i maybe maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption of what of what of what it was i was doing before i was before my number came up and i was told i had to come ba here what if what if unhu what if worrying about that see this is what you told deven well what if worrying about that has got in the way gotten in the way of you making positive choices for yourself in your life instead of just worrying about w that youre he and making the best out of it being here is is so illusive sometimes i mean illusionary those are two different words and they mean two different things well its illusionary i take back what i said about illusive y you may be elusive well mm yeah but but but uh to me the whole point is is you have no idea what happens before or after you have no idea you can read books about it and you can talk about it but the most pragmatic thing to do is to just live it hm learn the rules of the game play the game for what for whatever you wa for whatever you wa be a doctor or a screen writer or an actress or a philanthropist or an explorer an explorer do what you want with the time you have learn give whatever love lo love could i love you x could i love you while im here dont make light of what im saying n think about the kids what are who are who are these kids who are these kids these little seedpods that have been sent our way well sometimes for me they are a whip and a hairshirt theyre little little little lessons yeah ah yeah i mean sometimes i have to be real prep what xx natalie asked me about santa claus today what did she what did she say in the laundro she said mom santa claus isnt i mean d is there a for real sa santa claus i said a for real santa claus you mean a man who lives at the north pole she said yeah i said no and she said well who are the other ones i said well theyre the spirit of santa claus and they represent santa claus they theyre a picture of santa claus theyre santa clauss agents theyre pictures of santa claus is my mike on unhunh oh okay it sure is and you just damn near broke the damn needle there and then she said and then she said well who fills the stockings and i kind of i said love fills the stockings oh go pamela she said she said oh you mean adults adults who wanna show you how much they care and i said yeah adults adults around who love you fill those stockings and i said she said but some adults talk about santa claus i said thats because they wanna believe in santa claus and thats what i told her i said i wanna believe in santa claus in fact sometimes i d believe in santa claus and that that really satisfied her but i thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in june yeah but what d i thought to myself if she asked me that like on christmas eve well she must have gotten some sort of a signal somewhere today in the laundromat i mean what does that have to do with death well we were talking about death and illusions the illusions of this life you know i uh i uh i x x x my favorite word when i was twelve was paradox why because i thought any wor that was defined i mean i remember the definition that i learned in seventh grade that was paradox seemingly contrary seemingly x x x seemingly con and i had a hard time with the definition so i thought god a wor that im supposed to lear and i get this definition and i dont even understand the defini the definition of the word paradox is by design ambiguous chew on this one an ambiguous paradox is that redundant yes well that was age twelve so uh that was very close to devens age when i sort of bit my teeth into that one bit your teeth hunh and then yeah as i went i took a bite is is that like c it in the nip i i get a little ahead of myself yeah i guess you do oh god i hope this doesnt all sound real s x well uh from from twelve to seventeen then that went from paradox to the invisible interfacing with the visible hunh the invisible inter with the visible facing x for everything you see you can look at me and im a body you see eyes you see body you see hair you see s get your hands off me y see all those things right yea but theres theres me insi thats invisible its not its its n its its i mean what if what if you took the same spacesuit and you put another spirit into it it would be a different person itd say let me out it would be a different person youre right i wouldnt be me right thats right itd be a different personality so i i i think its very fascinating of course thats a hypothetical how do you know that its very interesti maybe may maybe may maybe the spacesuit has something to do with with whos inside of it i mean you dont know that wouldnt that be f a fascinating experiment well no be look genes genetic makeup its proven and thats part of the spacesuit if you wanna use that that that your genetic makeup largely determines who you are you mean the chemical bath i sit in yeah as it were hm sort of dictates how i feel about being in this spacesuit ye yes right r you know and it depends on your brain dolphin level and my brain dolphin xx x x mm thats sweet you know hunh i depend am yeah yeah a lot of it has to do with the with the the r five dollars and ninetyeight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you uh we could spend a lot of our life trying to to contradict that why well because it may be a very bad chemi bath we may b been put into something thats completely acid to our true essence yeah but we have no choice in that matter and we spend a lifetime thats right n well no apparent choice no choice that we know of mn yeah hm hm y yeah but but rather than than i mean im not im not im not all bent out of shape about it but ive just but i was thi x youre just really interested in dea my yearning my yearning my yearning is n maybe not to run ahead and and and and get to the exit as w i mean maybe its the yearning uh for where i was before i was born well how is write reading a book written by some schmuck who thinks hes an expert on d well he may or may not be a schmuck darryl anyone who sits down to write a book about d with the hopes of enlightening his fellow human beings is in my book a schmuck well now thems fightin wor boy you could who the hell is someone anyone whos living to sit down and write a book about dea now really you know its like uh its these this this is the person who falls under that that category of expert that i disdain so much i know a lot about maybe hes a very old soul plea like old king cole hm well if hes a very old soul he should keep it to himself you know uh uh i felt l after gretchen died it was all rather unfair i mean uh uh the tides at work just swept over her so quickly and it was like but really not so quickly it was yeah i mean it was something that had started in her a very long time ago she was gone in less than five months six eight months and it just amazes me i mean you cant drag on and on and on about a fellow creature whos gone but i still miss my grandmother and i i certainly miss my do i just

conversation so i go into la conversation and i picked out all this stuff for uncle arnold and it was just supposed to be mo ruben arnold and lisabeth and i was gonna sit down and talk with them and split so im driving up to the house and theres a car in front of me and the guy is just like sitting there in the middle of the roa and hes not moving and you know i wanna park the car you know and th theres no parking either uh on one of those sides because its street sweeping day or something its like would you mo so i can come park my car and then i realized its liza and antonio and theres cassandra jumping around jumping around jumping around inside the car nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah so it turns out that she wouldnt get out of the car with arnold and lisabeth so liza and antonio follow them over there to pick up cassandra and take her for a day in the park but then liza wanted antonio to see moms house so they go barging in on mar so mom felt obligated to ask those two idiots to lunch also thereby having to invi dear cassandra who we did not want there in the first place cause shes such a little piss ass so the first thing i get inside the house and theres cassandra jumping up and down jump jump jump jump jump jump jump and i grabbed her and i held her down and i go listen you little p ass this is my house and today you are not going to jump today youre gonna act like a h you got that she just looks at me she kind of nods her head uh shes terrified and shes going ah sh auntie linas here again i am leaving so she wants to go out on the balcony i grab her again

thats a good spot for her antonio had on white shoes im sorry i dont care if he is i i dont care that was the u set of shoes i ever saw in my life one of the kids at work said but alina it doesnt count unless he had a white belt and he di he did i dont care if its a white suit put something else he had on a white suit liza had on a um a black suit and then he stands there and tells her how its not it needs to be baggier here and theyre analyz they are so superficial they are into all this clothing he has a r or something or what does he do or wh who is he hes a waiter hes a waiter at rosas out there in ontario which is a very nice restaurant im sure but he wants to open his own restaurant someday and he thinks were gonna finance it actually thinks cathy and jawahar are or jonathan is cause theyre the wealthy ones i tried to explain to cathy that life had changed now for her that and that there were uh gonna be all sorts of parasitic relatives distant or whatever like jonathan coming up and saying did she tell you about jonathan yes trying to get him a jo oh yeah well then see thats another thing she doesnt understand it well tommy spencer well why alin uh cathy dont you understand that you know things are different now you have this mega house and uh you know you have this you know things are different but they they th the they kind of thrive on that they like having people having to owe th thats part of the reason theyre not burning their bridges right s to whe that is a great line to where is that hilarious thats typical thompson he is so funny but um my husband not your professor um no for this stupid new years eve party then tommy spencer whos up there who y was jonathan and lorens best friend right he x opens his big mouth to jonathan that cathy and jawahar are having this party so cathy calls me up and she wants jonathans ph address and i go for what she goes well we have to invite him to the new years eve party and i go why she goes well tommy spencer opened his big mouth and i said oh so youre going to host them are you she goes what do you mean host them i said if you invite them up there for a party theyre gonna assume that they are staying with you right she goes no theyre not nya and i said well thats what theyre gonna think and i said if you invite them youll also have to invite liza and antonio you want them staying at the house too so next thing you know they dropped at least that bridge they werent too unhappy about burning hm god but keith and sally those two b drips the one that told me i was shoveling my food and i didnt need a fork um theyre friends with this other friend of theirs and theyre trying to uh th th that they dont talk to anymore and i mean campbells a cocaine user abuser dealer thats all he does

night to see them i go what are you gonna do that for who cares uh does she have any friends you think no up there no why cathy shes not a good friend herself jawahars a really nice guy he is a nice guy he is but he doesnt understand how to mix friends at all we already went through that wh i first got back from italy and i was up there he we were friends with this one australian guy and he was friends with this other idiot from new zealand dennis and one night he figured oh both part of the same world you know f new zealand australia so he invited doctor spargo out with dennis well i didnt get along with dennis at all he was a jerk i did not like him period and spargo was okay and we go out and or we went out and these guy they were at each others throats the whole ni lo competition galore really oh yeah each one was fighting for our affection uh that was very apparent i knew that was gonna happen plus they didnt like each other spar well spargo was ol you know and he was real bright and he knew that this guy was a jerk if we went to parties and there was somebody who came up to try to talk to us hed keep em away x just like a little t um australian sheep dog running around rar rar rar rar rar rar all this protective stuff going on it was a lot of fun whoops im sorry xx knocked me off but cathy and jawahar dont understand how to mix their friends at all they dont understand that its also okay not to have everybody at the same party is she work you cant or doing anything no she works for jawahar but you know so then um what does this mean well she answers phones wasnt she she said she wanted to go back to schoo or something do something with her life or shes too into computers theyre boring you know arent they boring theyre so boring i mean its like who care no offense but i think that you can get caught up in computers like within what five weeks or something you gotta sit there and you you know oh you you space out on it shes like talking about ro and ra and you know and she i know shes p about it im like uh i cant relate lea me alone i cant relate at all i just i dont care i really dont care i this party i went to friday night where joy was

ill go if i want and i dont joy i like cause shes really interesting but a lot of those other paddlers are idiots i did not wanna go so i walk in shes changing apartments shes moving into her own condo i walk in and the first hint that theres uh this is gonna be something a little bit unusual is theres all these helium balloons ut up at the ceiling with x uh metallic color streamers coming down three streamers each balloon i mean the whole ceiling is just packed with these helium balloons it was so much fun so i walk in and i see two of the paddlers i definitely dont wanna see one of which had a halloween party i told her were coming we show up shed already left for another party i said why the hell didnt you tell me you were leaving oh well i thought youd you know m i didnt think you were coming alina i said if i say im showing up i show up we had to go some place for hectors work first you know the wonder years where i got insulted by this other little assistant twat who since has been fired thank g but anyway um then you know we showed up there and they were all gone that really irritated me you know x x what do you mean yes ha im having a party come and you show up

got those from saks fifth off theyre m you know theres nothing gr about those pants and theyre f and theres p in them you know where i mean they use substandard stuff so theres uh you know these goofy little white spots and everything and theyre going oh alina you look so ch in your suede pants and im going oh yeah real ch you know my hairs dirty i have it pulled back in a pony tail i know i look lovely so im sitting there talking to these idiots for a while then this new wa of people comes in and these three guy walk in and one guy was so geeky hes in a suit who the hell do you know goes to a party in a suit i mean who is this g so anyway the other guy had a real nice shirt on and then there was some other geek so the guy with the nice shirt came in and started talking to me and he t his names like billy mulholland or something and hes um from bakersfield originally and joys father had hired him to to sell or joy had actually hired him to sell jewelry in hawaii from her fathers store but now hes sells v_real estate in malibu and hes got a painting con uh contracting whatever and uh one of the things that theyre doing is um is painting this building on melrose so it looks like you can see through the wall cause theres you know plastic first and then this stuff behind it or whatever it is but his renditions of homosexuals i thought i was gonna die and i i hadnt you know i just looked at him he was going on and on about how these guys at his work cause hes down there supervising work and he looks out and these guys and he starts talking about their gstrings are showing through their tight leather pants and x he was just going on and on and on and i was getting hysterical i was laughing so hard and i just finally looked at him and i said hey i never even th about it because i grew up in the swish alps you know we have been here our whole lives and i said i never knew anybody who was in the closet because as far as im concerned theyve always been out of the closet well he couldnt handle this that i actually knew gay people he walked away from me god so the next guy that comes up and starts talking to me is the guy in the suit and it turns out hes from georgia atlanta georgia and hes tal away to me and he his name is dr and i said oh like doctor and he goes exactly right hes a thoracic surgeon or some horse manure but meanwhile its just like this right here in my face and i kept backing up back up uh and hes right here in my face and he keeps star at my chest and its like you know f you asshole why dont you look at my fa oh shit but he didnt believe me i was ma i kept t hes talking about how we should carry on a conversa later and im going no no i said i dont you know i really dont think my husband would appreciate that i said you know its a little difficult having three in the same bedroom a you know at least thats not my shtick but um he he didnt believe me that i was married he thought i was giving him the brushoff thats c so they had their other friend come over and meet me whos a lawyer and its really bizarre cause i guessed all of their ages and they were like blown away they were saying well thats what happens when youre this elderly age but um meanwhile in had walked these two really s kind of scruffy looking guy you know not cause these guys were all like you know mister hip and here comes these two other guys ones a black guy and ones this uh white guy with this beard uh and hes got like a lorimar sweatshirt on so im sitting there and uh the d lorimar dr kept trying to talk to me talk to me you know dr dr doctor he is a doctor yeah but thats all hed give his name for oh but go hes had an interesting command of the english language because all double entendres you know but if you didnt understand your english you didnt understand what he was saying so he was actually a lot of fun to s_talk to i had a good time with him thats actually even b how we even started tal and he started talking to one of the other paddlers whos k probably going through a divorce this year and he used the same lines on her and she didnt get it oh well so you know he was like really bored and left but anyway i started talking to the black guy when dr walked off and uh you know all of a sudden youre realizing this guy is stringing sentences complicated sentences together and y he knows what youre talking abou and hes dropping literary terms and names and youre kind of going where are you from hes a hes a army brat and has he speaks fluent german hes lived in about thirty places and i said god you know that must have really made you d uh you know its you must have a good time at making new friends its easy for you and he said oh yeah he had that but also what itd done is it caused him to be introverted so he read a lot when he was a kid so hes really self taught and you know kind of one of the things he did was he kind of took up the guitar at twelve now hes thirtyfi you ought to hear that guy on the guita hes absolutely am the guy with the bear was his good buddy they both work for the phone company the guy with the beard must be about six four six five and uh he got his first degree in fire science his parents were his mother was fortyeight when he was born his father was fiftyone they died when he was thirteen he put himsel he k graduated from high school early went through fire science major at ucla i forgot the people from the west side do that a lot they go through this stupid fire science major out at ucla become firemen and now he uh_you know and now he works for the phone company and hes hes uh putting himself hes going to be a microwave engineer and hes going to csun because thats the only place you can go at night wow brilliant hes been in there since nineteen eighty hunh im sitting there you know hes like thirty now talking to him he had a big old hicky here he told me he was going to another party i said oh you want a matching set oh go the black guy laughed he goes oh you noticed i said yeah turtlenecks dont hide everything but the black guys father works with the um cia oh you kidding so no he set up so the black guy set up all the phones during the olympics and he was the best like guy out there at the olympics or you know he had g special coverage and special protection and everything wow but they were so much fun to talk to i had a ball i ended up you know and uh all the paddlers were going yeah alina talking to all the boy dont they know youre marrie are you they said like i told dr just cause im married i aint dead i still like to go to parties im sorry shit and he goes so youre married and i said yeah im married and i said so is he hes married too and he goes oh well that makes it convenient then uh i always like it when both of you are married to each o and i said so do i xx hector uh oh god poor little hector hes been having a hell of a time pulling his hair out hes been grumpy for three months well its o now isnt it yeah he was actually talkative tonight when i called him on the phone he tal to me for like fifteen minutes tonight do you know how long its been since hes been able to k talk to me on the phone who does he work with now kevin rosen ke no uh well yeah rosenblums down the hall and then its kevins his assistant and then they dont have the third editor but its so ni him and ke essentially yeah yeah kevins his assistant but theyre trying to get kevin to kevins been in production before hes ha actually been associate produ before and they want ke to take h place thats a possibility but jake will block it otherwise known as n whos gonna take hectors whos gonna nix nix it nixon nixon so uh whos gonna take hectors place it i dont know theyll have to see they gonna bring in some neurotic from new jersey yeah sounds like a good idea somebody that could sit there and take orders and listen to what they have to say and how they wanna do it part of the problem with this whole thing was that uh how i see it was that ellen was not relinquishing t her duties to let hector go ahead and run it ja was feeling threatened sc because associate producer is supposed to run editorial and b it makes sense hector had an emmy nomination i would let him run editorial i would let him do anything he wanted to do in editorial they clipped his wings they wouldnt let him do anything there are three shows in trouble he was not allowed to help on any of em none of em thats changed now though he can be like he was before again yeah edit and the neurotics are out well whats gonna happen that he is editorial period cause st stevies supposed to leave in february so unless they f they they have to look for an editor rosenblums coming back though isnt he i dont know what hes gonna do he wants to work actually features he doesnt really wan do tv hm i went and saw their house the other night where is it their new house its u you know where beverly glen is its one of those streets off of there its a nice little uh north or south of sunset oh south of course way down oh theyre right off of pico and i know how crass true cuz but its in right next door is ted rich whos uh one of the biggies at mtm or lorimar or mgm oh i forgot which one one of them one of those places it all means the same to me you know really i can never tell the difference m mgm lorimar except one day hector was s you know they were scoring the show last week and i and i called up to talk to him and i could hear the um the musicians in the back tuning up their instruments and then you know and its okay to talk to hector i could hear him a little bit but not too well but you know i still could tal to him and the next thing you hear all these h blar so he said lina i have to go no shi i cant hear you at all sweetheart call me when i can hear you it was funny thats the only part ill miss so x x but x his position is pretty uh uh stable yeah fletcher well see actually fletcher was going to ask hector to move back to editorial but he didnt know how to approach him cause he thought he was so thrilled about being associate producer but hector really ha it so hectors the one when was it two weekend two weekends ago or last weekend he c he said he looked at me and he goes p_so lina what happens on hanukkah and i was going i cant exactly remember the story but all i know is you light a candle and open a present and he goes so if i call fletcher it wouldnt be any great shakes and i said nope i said what h he di never told me why he was calling up fletcher so uh um sunday he looked at me and he goes im calling fletcher i want to go back to editorial i said okay go ahead so he called fletcher and fletcher was so relie cause he wanted to ask hector to move back to editorial hes just happy he did it why did he want to ask hector to move back to editorial because hes so unhappy with the editorial staff that they couldnt get what they wanted out of sherry and they couldnt get what it they wanted out of seppie its actually not seppies fault its kind of they needed to work with him more but that sh was impo she was a witch and then her assistant pulled stunts where she didnt do stuff that everybody knows assistants do which i wouldnt know but cause im no assistant but things like making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects so that they can follow alo and make certain that their sound effects are going in the right spots that kind of thing she totally screwed up the the show that theyre working on now i dont know what number that is sylvia what show is being shown now well its the one theyre working on v the one theyre working ons not always the one thats being shown no but what one is tonight tonight i dont know four five six this i i dont know well have to ch oh this is the second one in the new sea hm but i dont know if this was really number two h how they placed it or if it was like like you said number three four or five because they had such a b hard time with it like last weeks wasnt supposed to be shown even though it was supposed to be number one because it was so poorly done it had so much wrong with it hector kept trying to get it corrected like a month ago and they kept stopping him stopping stopping stopping stopping cause of her cause of her cause of ja nixon he didnt want him to do it and it makes him look like an idiot cause hes the director and you can tell where he missed the shots has n whatsoever to do with anybody el its ja but hell s hed cut off his nose to spite his face thats s so now fletchers starting to realize whats going on its hard because the h man actually in the group is ed eds the one thatll come in and hell go ahead and say this is what needs to be done okay and h or hell look at you and hell go that was a s thing to do whyd you do that you know makes the editor really stop and think or makes whoever it is stop and think the director but fletcherll kind of sit there and kind of go we m well let me see that that seemed to be okay but ill have to think about it hes real wishywashy hes too uh namby pamby you need somebody to come in and go yeah t_so theyre kind of suffering that uh from that this year not having that on there but fletchers having to learn how to be more assertive otherwise his shows just gonna go down the tubes yeah and they cant afford that right now how many countries is it in do you know mm all i know is cathy saw it in france oh really yeah i forgot what its called some huh its about has to do with the bar generation um the b gen generati yeah uh uh uh what what is it the b generation in what sense bar generation oh no uh pub the pub the pub generation there you go pu french so cathy they watched it in french g it was absolutely hilarious oh go i know cu i know i thought that was really funny dorks the generation wow have it in france i know thats good and they they saw mako did i tell you harlans wife where they had dinner with her one night yeah and cathy said oh yeah supposedly alinas been on this diet and lost weight she said oh you mean shes not so ch ooh waitll i see that bitch again was that nasty or what god i said i wasnt gonna do this anymore stay up late kinda defeats the purpose of getting up in the morning i know and its a hard habit to break usually i dont it i s uh usually i dont stay up late but its like if im up after midnight its just like hm yeah yeah what can i do now i still cant uh god i still cant believe tim bitching around and he lied too he said that he talked to ron and all this other shit about what about uh the way they were feeling of them being the only ones cleaning the house and all this other shit i mean what they dont realize is like shit when ron gets home from wor i wanna spend time with ro because ron usually doesnt get home till nine or ten yeah unlike tim he has to w for every little dime that he makes you know yeah he doesnt get any breaks yeah tim is on salary and he can take lea and mhm and he earns lea hes he gets sick leave we dont get shit i dont know it is really hard living with another couple i mean we if we set our if we sit down and set some rules which we never did uh uh it could work you know mhm what it amounts to is mutual r respect and l like tim told ro he told him he goes um what was it he goes nobody fucks with my lifestyle i feel the exact same way and all those bitches and complaints that he has theyre about my lifestyle mhm and he doesnt realize that and thats what im gonna tell him we uh you know and the only way its gonna work is if we have respect for one another thats right thats right and it doesnt mean going to our parents and complaining about one another im gonna tell him if you have any complaints you talk to the person that you have the complaint about im also going to suggest weekly house meetings to discuss such things mhm oh yeah yeah you know what it would be a real good lesson for them too in self assertiveness yep you know and especially the way um i mean tim gets in himself into a uncomfortable situation or whatever and his first reaction is to blow up about it mhm you know cause he let he lets it pile up yep he doesnt do nothing positive about it and then he just blows up and if something bothers you you go and you i was like last year i was really proud of myself when i was asked to take over intermediate algebra unhunh and teach it and i di and i also went and i asked for a raise instead of cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour i was now gonna be up there teaching it mhm and instead of getting the five dollars an hour i ended up getting fifteen really but i went and i asked now if i you know if you put a situation like that to tim or mandy cause not because theyre theyre weak in character or anything but because theyre theyre babies yeah they hem and haw around and somebody else would have to talk for them you know yeah i dont know and its right now uh i dont know if i should mention it to him or what but im feeling like hes taking me for granted yep and hes rolling in it mary and you know what the sad thing the thing that really scares me is that theyre n th at the rate theyre going and with all the breaks that theyve gotten theyre never gonna have hard times hard times do train you yep they do like i came over here to work with danae which is what im going to do im going to do some translations for her and stuff yeah tonight a um you know i have to make at least f dollars or so to make it worth my time but like tonight well i called you know this thing was going on with buck and everything so i called um mandys or i called our house and mandy answered the phone and i said wheres you know wheres where is ron there and she said no when we were on our way to tims game he was at town pump and he asked what time wed be home and we said probably about nine and she said then we went over to your grandmas but then we came back and he wasnt here yet so i called the town pump and asked if he was still in the casino course he wasnt he was on his way home and i said tell so i called mandy back and i told her to have him call me when he got home so i was in the bathtub when he called and i talked to him for a while and he went and he was really down about what what i told h that tim had said to me and how i was so upset he goes why didnt you tell him to go and wake me up i said i di and he wouldnt do it really mhm he goes they w they were sitting around getting all fucked up he said but he said i went right to bed he said i didnt get done working until after nine oh ma cause that fivecar pile up they had between hardin and crow oh shit really i didnt hear about it yeah ron was s there with one wrecker g yeah seems like any time ive seen a wrecker out here theres always two guys in there hmm x everyone was gone when the call came in oh and jays not supposed to go on those anymore because of his heart so he had to send ron by himself and ron was s pulling everybody out of the ditch did they all hit each other or just kind of a a semi bumped a car and then went and went on two wheels and just about lost it and then got back up on all all its wheels again oh did it land in the ditch but it kind of it was able to get out but all the other cars that were in the direct vicinity all hit the ditch and then there was three cars and the semi and then this uh this guy pulled up and he was going to uh peggy you remember peggy white yeah her husband gary bighare mhm him and her pulled up and they were in the van and they stopped to ask ron what happened and here another car came and rearended em oh and they ended up having to take um peggy white by helicopter to billings man thats pretty ba i know darn this darn dog keeps breathing and like dreaming you know i wonder if we should wake her up no shell get scared and want to go outside kinda nervous you know they say you can really mess up a dog by waking em up when theyre dreaming really mhm its so cold outside but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there i know you know what i was thinking of doing hunh i dont know shes kind of shy but i was wondering what it would be like to train her to pull a sled i dont know if shed do it i dont know if she would either shes kind of timid mhm she doesnt trust too many people at all yeah oh and you know another thing that tim had the audacity to bitch about what he said um mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree until four in the morning and i even asked if we could put our ornaments on there and they told me that there wouldnt be enough room really mhm tim said that she was probably lonely when she was doing it you know that she probably was x i sat up with her and i was talking to her she was doing all the decorating i mean what was i gonna do she i mean she was just putting up the balls and everything and shed say where where do you think this should go and so i was sitting there doing my welfare application and uh you know i was just sitting there watching her telling her where to put everything and what not did you know nickie wanted her own tree ye and i forgot to bring it in its outside what are you gonna do with it she wants to set it up for her barbies i was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom mhm and just stick it in there and you know what i did hm i didnt want to waste a trees life so i just cut a branch off one god i fell up there whered you go to get em you know where sarah and arvela live mhm just around the corner remember that first cattle guard you go over unhunh i didnt even go over that you mean kinda like by the by the tunnel right below the tunnel oh and i just walked up w just walked up around uh that area god alice that was f did you get grandma a tree too hunhunh does she already have one hmm that pickup could only hold like three mm i wonder why did daddy say to take the pickup back or what was the deal yeah yeah why cause phoebe needs it whats wrong with the car oh you didnt hear about it hunhunh oh you did about how the engine was on fire mhm see there was oil spilling out leaking out from the valve cover mhm the valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever and there was oil coming out and the oil got hot and you know how it gets hot and smokes mhm well i guess enough came out because we were losing oil bad going from billings to crow um theres a lot of smoke coming out and by the time we got to hardin we had to put like uh three or four quarts in unhunh it was three an by the time we got to crow it was it was one quart low and there was smoke still coming from under the engine i figure w if it was losing that much oil then it caught fire mhm cause the engine was hot cause there wasnt enough water in the radiator mhm i talked to oscar about it and he said well i checked it was only it was only about id say a half a quart to a quart short of water but that shouldnt make any difference he goes the only thing i can think of is that there was an air lock in there and that running the engine out on the open road mh c that air lock to come through flushed it out and bust th gasket no it would more or less um the engine wasnt being kept cool enough cause there wasnt enough fluid in the radiator unhunh and you know how the radiators the pipes close to other parts of the en yeah so what it was some part in there caused the f the engine being too hot and the oil leaking so he knew that the oil was leaking no we knew we were losing oil but we didnt know where i just figured it was from that valve cover gasket just from lifting up the hood and looking at it so whats he gonna do well and two of his wires the sparkplug wires unh were fried all the way through unhunh so we took those off and we replaced them with some old ones out of the garage i knew tha and it runs it runs theres enough uh radiator fluid in there mhm so that it will its its enough mhm but i think running it out on the open road will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out mhm that valve cover gasket has to be replaced hm i dont know oh i freaked cookie and rita and gary out tonight remember the plain plainfeather uh claypit where that red clay is mhm right there i saw my my speedometer just go brr like that just dow you know and i knew exactly what it was what i have to do is take off the distributor wire and splice it in with the fuel pump wire mhm because my fuel pump is now electric never used to be mhm hand me that ashtray or your light i mean your light its behind the sewing machine and uh sometimes it gets loose and no more fuel unhunh so i stopped the car and they said what are you doing i said oh i gotta tighten this wire here so i had cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off so cause see once you turn that key on then you hear the the fuel pump come on mhm and if the wires not connected right it doesnt come on mhm so i did that and i lit a match to find out where i was and n after everything was hunkydory then i shut the hood and got back in and i started up the engine and both gary and rita were sitting on the edges of their seat and i turned around and i looked and i said did i scare you kids they wouldnt say anything then gary goes yeah i was scared but i freaked em out i dont know then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing work mhm said long as i dont drive it fast it should be alright but oh man i dont know see the thing about it is if i go after ken im not really gonna have any money mhm to um you know do things im not saying im gonna pay for everything but i dont want to be broke around him i know that really sucks cause i wanna at least be able to put gas in the car mhm and go do something i dont think its such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter mm ive been thinking about that we should all get some money together and is there any way he could like meet us in great falls or something cause id like to go up there and go to the um red lobster really yeah cause ive been just cr seafood thats the half point he could do it yeah i bet he could do it when though i dont know he goes back to school like the secon uh oh shoot well isnt there any way like we that we could just m him up there and maybe what bring him down bring him down or i dont wanna take your car i was gonna ask you and m too if you could um take care of trace for a couple days next week oh what you got in mind i need to get caught up on my work wednesday i have an appointment at nine thirty moms off isnt she oh thats righ thats right yeah i think thatd i think thatd um work out like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her and help her with him and nicky helps her with him alot anyway and then of course he adores me mhm i remember i was pregnant with nicky and uh bootss little boy he really liked me mhm when i was pregnant with her mhm uh you know how it is when were pregnant we get real sleepy mhm id fall asleep on the couch and hed lay by me mhm and hed fall asleep with me and i remember he would i woke up and here he was gone his mother carried him in the other room mhm and god that kind of pissed me off was would u was nicky mad when trace was a boy kind of she thinks i should have twins twin girls but i dont think shell realize the uh sibling rivalry but i dont know shes six years old now and they say that if theres six years between children theres not that much rivalry after four theres almost none really mhm cause theyre four is i theyre kind of in different worlds yeah because see trace will be the next time i have a baby trace will probably be about three four hm thats when im gonna get this shit taken out tammy kashen has one of these too what is it norplant oh really deon told me cause i asked him what his intentions were with her cause i told him i thought he was too young to be so involved gwen was telling me that did she talk to you lately hmm they had a cyst on her ovary and they had to go in and take it out mhm take out that cyst mhm and its really screwed up her uh menstrual p cycle her cy her her hormones unhunh and they said that she might have to get pregnant again just to straighten it out so and then she goes so tell tell deon and she really laughed i dont know if tammy would be too happy with that though seems to me that shes trying to straighten herself out and pursue a family tammy what do you think i dont know or do you think it might be a matter of convenience i think its a convenience for both of em yeah yeah its also a convenience for cookie oh yeah okay u the the way that your testimony is coming in i dont know if i explained this to you o the ph hmm is when a person is charged with multiple crimes a u there are other incidences where he acted in the same way mhm when we have to prove in this case we have to prove specific intent to expose himself to a person for sexual arousal mm u when we have to prove something like specific intent um or we have to prove identity because hes disputing identity in a coup in at least one of the cases hm u then w are allowed to bring in prior similar conduct u where he acted in a an identical way or where the victims were in a similar situation okay things like that thats why were able to have you come in and testify okay okay u the cases that we have already are um one happened back in october of nineteen ninety alright and it happened on bart and its almost a carbon copy of your case well ive made two one a year from almost a year from the uh police report i saw that in your report i havent seen the other re yeah i made that one through matter of fact it was just over the phone and they never called me back or anything and a year later it happened again okay a then thats when they made the report and said they were gonna do something about it okay s it hap around so you can testify to two of em uh yeah thats why i had you come up becau yeah u thats great yeah um i mean not for you but mhm for us u i in our first case amelia gonzalez um that uh that happened back in ninety and she was seated a in the rear of the train yeah which you were mhm u nobody else was around and he sort of walked up and down the train down the ais mhm checked every ou y and then sat dow m put the newspaper on his lap y mas and then lifted the paper up yeah for her to see and she saw it in the the re n n oh the mirror cause she was looking out the window thats how i did it too saying i dont want to s this cause i didnt want to see him so i looked this way and you can see it right you know cause it turns into the mirror effect yeah mhm and he was just sort of staring at her and lifting up the paper yeah mhm u so anyway exact uh it c its a carbon copy yeah a um in that case hes uhuh he sits through all the testimony and he just sort of shakes his head and makes these big gasps like you know were creating this whole thing ag him hm u and then with june um the woman that just walked ou unhunh u she was riding on bart and he came and sat near her she moved he moved to get closer to her she moved again and he moved directly oppo her mhm and then started masturbating yeah so well see what it is it seems like he wants someone more scary y i dont kno cause he would walk up and down the aisles there was women on the other side too but theyd look like you know you wouldnt mess with em but if youre sitting there you know trying to mind your own business or right look like you can intimidate someone you know right i i x thats what it look like i think thats i think he he finds somebody thats isolated mhm a he goes for a certain age group i think yeah u a you know like uhuh for some reason i think he likes students or people who look like stud unhunh mhm so anyway okay u did you as far as your um mileage goes what would did oh how much w it hundred and thirty s i dont know okay and we got the um that ticket for our x parking yeah okay they moved the ga or something the how to get in the parking lot cause it used to be on x oh y y bec they built this bui oh see thats where the yeah we had to get back all the way on the freeway oh no and i was like oh god there was a door here before a entrance you know yeah i couldnt find it but uh we found it um oh okay do you know how much its gonna be oh no not yet okay u do you guys have the cash to pay for it right now when you to get out yeah i think so yeah yeah okay then what ill do is when you can ill call you and find out okay what i have to do is submit all of this to our accounting department okay and they give you the theyll mail you the reimbursement okay so you guys hang on to that okay s you ca get out okay alright and then i imagine it will be about five dollars or so okay u so a hundred and thirty about a hundred and thirty five you think yeah m hm okay so round trip itll be like t seve two si yeah thats from salinas mhm do you go by rickie reeding r reeding rollins or do you just go by rickie rollins uh r u well my name is regina i just go by rick okay uh i dont know if you have to put my regina in there y proba um i regina rollins is fine i doesn matter okay okay whatever is easier for you guys you guys newly married well just a year a yea two days ago oh great soon youll be in my condition which is p aw really a con yeah thanks okay lets just go through um i i have your statement but i just want to have you tell me o what happened alright u do you remember the date n okay because ill be saying to you do you reca o august twelfth nineteen ninety two okay okay and it was about one oclock mhm okay so first of all where did you get on bart a oakland okay and where were you going u to the doctors in san francisco san francisco a u when you got on bart ill ask you to describe where you sat on the tr okay and let me show you um what i have this is a diagram of the interior of bart mhm okay looking at that these are the b of the seats yeah so facing that way okay o u can you u thats the train right right u that seat right there i always sit going backwards i have okay so the train was tra that way yeah un okay so u and its hard to describe how so yeah i was sitting backwards in the back seat okay the very end seat a when he came in when where was he when you first saw him c in uh h got on the trai o like i think twelfth street or something in oakland and like in a let me see okay he got on another car but you can i i seen him because i seen him a year ago unhunh so i seen him when the you know how the trai goe and you can see everybody out the window well he got in another door o an he came through here okay alright so he came through he mhm when he came through here did he look at you at all m ini yeah what did he do just loo he had a did he s walking n just kinda loo and then loo and then walked okay and then he kept walking yeah when he looked at you the first time was he sort of looking you up and down or did he just look at your seat wh ju like you know look uh uh i guess x at you at me di o yeah and look at my seat cause i always sit all the way to the window okay so i thought he was gonna sit down actually okay hunh and then he continued on unhunh and where di he go he went all the way to the you know into the trai all the way up h m o and the uh he went through the door and then he ca back again okay he went through th he went through these doors into it unhunh into another car oh and then he came back again and then i guess that was like another stop and more people were getting off and the thats when he came and s b me sat in this seat right here but there was someone sitting there too there was a lady youre kidding unhunh there was a lady sitting there but she got up and she went to another seat ah she she just went to a different seat okay you know like but he was m uh i dont know how you describe it you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone mhm o you may sme or some yeah you know like that you know yeah or mo arou you know like as he wanted her to move okay and she got up and m s she okay u and so when she moved was there anybody seated x in this area i think maybe like you know how these chairs are unhunh maybe right he and you know okay but you couldnt they couldnt see nothing o anybody okay but nobo righ n xx in these area i dont bel so okay alright so then wh did he do u did the newspaper uh you know looking at it you know making loud noises i guess so i think like that or whatever the he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that and the he went i and then he just you can just see him going like this you know how you have to unzip your pa yeah or something like tha and im looking through the w and then hes still making n with the paper and then um i kinda looked and then i didnt and i kept making like s uh you know like you know like i know what youre he was ma noi like that no he was making those you know the rattling p unhunh but i was making noises like you know like i wanted him to know i know what youre doing yeah you know i remembered him for a year from a year ago and so then i just kept you know i just turned you know away from him and i looked in the window and he just kept hitting the paper like that you kno but you know what he wa do yeah he kept hitting the paper and um uh let me see then one time i jus you know kinda looked over and then you can see it you know you can see it had he l up the paper in any way or yeah just like you know im trying to see how a paper goes likes thi like this okay uhuhuh like he has the paper like like thi just like you know moves it like that you know like that oh you know and you can see it okay you know was he looking at you at all during that time ye the who enti ti okay i mean not looking at first he would go like this even with the paper and look at me you know trying to get my attention yeah like he wanted me to look at him and then the whole time under here hed just look i mean uhuh he looked so hard that it was like burning you know what i mean yeah it tell the jury that okay thats i mean thats gr he just alright uh u because thats what he does okay and thats his way of drawing your attention to him mhm bec if somebodys doing that to you theres no way youre gonna you know just totally ignore them yeah cause youre always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision at least yeah m to ma sure wh they a mhm yeah cause i was you know i didnt know what he was gonna do yeah or any so so um part of our burden is to prove that hes deliberately doing th that he has the specific intent to draw your atten to him okay so let them know that he was do that okay alright u okay so then and then he sort of pulled the paper aside and hes still staring at you yeah unhunh sti sta and just you know and the but when uh uh like you come to a stop see thats all through the tunnel you know thats a long like about mhm five minute ride or something a couple of minutes ride and we got t like embarcadero he would just you know go like this you know before anyone got on and wait and then just do the same thing until i had to get off at my stop tell the jury about that too be tha indicates that he knew what he was doing was wro hm oh okay and if there was a chance that any man might w by y mhm you know i had another case or i have a pr report from another case where u he wa he was crouched down and doing it mhm and then when a man would walk by hed sit up yeah and you know do nothing and then once the man was through the doors then hed go back x x doing it yea okay so u o so then you got off at your stop yeah u and how were you feeling we it was like s i dont know sorry you doing alright just i dont know like disgusted you know wh why i really wanted to report it this time because it was like summertime unhunh and the kids you know the kids and every yeah thats what i was scared of because i know how uh i was you know a victim of you know abuse like that or uh i just you know i just thats what i was think the very first time i reported it was just like this dirty old ma just that tha yeah and this time it was during the summer and there was lots of ki and um i just felt like you know upset you know yeah and i jus you know i just felt upset okay you know n tell the jury that um its its real important that they understand the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you uhuh cau my one concern about this case i u that some people may have the a of well he never touched you mhm he didnt make any verbal threats to you its no big deal a especially i have some young single men on my jury panel mhm a uh i my worry is that they dont relate to what a woman feels whe so like that is happening mhm because their experience would be totally different if a man exposes himself which a man would never do that mhm becau number one they pick out i think more vulnerable peo mhm but if u a ma were to be exposed to they would laugh or you know be disgusted mhm or be mad but they would ne feel scared or threat unhunh hi h can i sit with you sure u so r relate that information to the jury okay okay u and then uh so then when you got off you called the poli no right i went upstairs to the bart and told them and i tried to tell them what train it was an i just i was still kind of like shocked so i i was like well i have to go cause i have to make an appointment but i di tell someone i said ill be back to make a report or whatever i had to do and then there was a different person down there and when i called the bart police they said oh no ones even said anything to us you know and uh yeah that was that and then i think uh couple of days after one of the uh detectives called me and then i made a report he wanted to see if i can id him first and then we just made a report and he said hell submit it and everything okay a y ided him immediately unhunh he just showed me hes all okay come with me come with me you know okay alright i have uh a and this is i if they make an issue out of it this is what you looked at right m like a folder with different yeah yeah right there a i have the one where you signed right under it unhunh yeah and weve got the statement where you immediately said im hundred percent sure this is the guy mhm yeah so okay what is he a old man hes like sixt in his yeah yeah go and he like balding like yeah you can come in the courtroom oh good okay yeah um she has anxiety attacks when she ge excited a see thats why im s sh gets real ne and scared thats why i am tra unhunh she has bad anxiety attacks i cant breathe she shell ju oh really thats why im trying to yeah sh thats why shes crying okay so okay u uh m how do i have to look at anyone just you or no you can just look at me okay um when you go in let me explain to you what the courtrooms like so you know what to expect okay u you you dont have to you know and if you if you feel like you need to take a break mhm the tell me immediately okay u or ask the judge youll be seated right near the judge okay u i was saying to june that you know a lot of times people are intimidated by the courtroom and they think its really formal a its really not that formal mhm okay u the jurors that are in there therell be twelve people seated in the juror box mhm a u you know they could be your family they could be your friends mhm u theyre all uhuh y y from all walks of li mhm u theyre all different ages a u they you know for the most part they were probably very nervous when they came in just for jury duty yeah so u they just want to hear your story and theyre not judging you okay u let me show you xx x x baby hm hmm mhm will it help to have him in there yes unhunh good she was going crazy all day here i think thats him every time every time she seen a xx the whole time down here i was like that aint him i was doi that thats him thats him like that he was like o no no its not him just come o i dont know where i drew it out so is he in like jail or something or he just shows up for court no hes out right now oh o he will be oh o at the end of this if the jury does the right thing alright u we asked for ninety days county jail before the case went to trial mhm and normally u itll be higher if hes convicted okay so plus hes got your case pending in oakland oakland and if theres a if we get a conviction just on one case here mhm then your case in oakland will be a felony oh okay so alright u okay yu w what will happen is youll walk into the courtroom here mhm there are door right here yeah there are seats right here u that are for the audience but normally theres nobody in the audience but okay your husband will be there u a then there are two tables right here ill be seated at this table mhm an the defendant and the defense attorney will be seated at this tab mhm the jury sits here okay all in a row u then and youll walk thr when you walk in youll walk through and ill walk with you okay u to the ch the witness chair o okay which faces out this way alright and the judge is seated right here alright right ab you and then theres a woman who sits here whos the clerk and theres a woman who sits here the whos the court reporter okay a so when i ask you questions when youre talking you need to uh always say yes or no as opposed to unhunh or unh o ok or nodding your head okay because she takes everything down okay u if your nervous please tell me okay or tell the judge and we can take a break okay if you want to get a drink of water or something like that okay o u a take your time you know when you w in just take a deep breath okay take your time if i ask you a question that you dont understand tell me okay u if we either of us ask you a question where u its something you dont remember its a detail that you dont remem mhm its fi to say i dont i dont remember at this time okay okay u is there gonna b the other person his lawyer gonna ask some questions yeah cross examine hell be able to a you questions also hes hes a very polite guy okay hes a young attorney u hes with the public defenders office hes u w when we had the case the last time it was a different attorney mhm and th attorney terrorized my my one victim that i put on u he walked up to her and he was about this far away from her mhm and sh cause she had testified when he walked in initially and he looked at me walter munson she said i i knew he was a pervert just by the way he looked at me oh so this man walked up to him and he said im standing close to you im looking at you does that make me a pervert mhm a uh just badgered her a but thi this attorney is not like that at all okay hell be very polite u mhm hes going to try and focus more on uh discrepancies like if you testify to one thing and theres something written differently in the report unhunh he might say well you know in your in the report it says that you um you know he sat dow right across from you mhm imm oh okay as opposed to wal or some like that okay which it doesnt but okay u hes gonna try and focus on little things cause thats all he can do okay but for the most part hell be polite and gentle okay so you dont have to worry about him hm u what hap well tell me about the year ago incident u that one was at night time and um i was working la and it was around i remember i used to get off ar around nine and i used to get to um the bart station around ten oclock a he would be uh i think im trying to think would he get o or would he already be on well thats the daly city one so he would get on when i would get on but i think probably like a different car and same thing exact identical go up and down the aisles but i would be the only one in the train you know because at night time theres not many people on there and he would do that and i was i was terrified then because i was the only one there was n one around yeah i you know i was a little scar this time but uh you know but theres people around like you know i dont think he would do anythi when people are around right you know down at the other seat or in back right i could scream but yeah at night time he was doing the same thing and i called that night to the bart poli and i told them what he looked li and everything and i never heard anything again so o u did he use a newspaper that time al m so identi every yeah ok and then i even told them i said and the funny thing is he just the only thing he changed this time is um he wore a new bow tie and uh a different bag cause he always had a ba cause the what made the interested in this case they s told me well everyones telling me he has this bag he carries around and he has a bowtie like that and i go yeah thats the only difference he had a different bag this time a year later and a different bow tie yeah and they were like okay you know now the bag that he was carrying around this time what was it m let me see i think a duffel bag i th okay okay one time it was a duffel bag and then one time it was like a uh what do you call them like a sh like a old be shopping bag yeah a shopping bag a plas yeah yeah mhm thats his common one plastic bag filled with paper okay y yeah in this one you say hes carrying a sho a duffel bag a duffel bag okay ok so you wanna have you read through your statement recently n do you wanna read through it yeah okay okay hm uhuh now you cant do anything to this guy oh im not im just gonna sit back and look m im a little worried about her cause she has them anxiety attacks x she just dont have no control over her body tr when will the verdict be u well it depends uh you two are my last witnesses and then the defendant will t and then we could do closing arguments today or it could be tomorrow and then w we should have a verdict by friday afternoon o no la than friday afternoon so ill call all of you and tell you is he gonna take the stand he says so mhm h what could he possibly say he testified in a trial u about five years ago sa identical situa r and he said his testimony was my momma didnt raise me to do things like this he totally denied it mhm so so cause i was just telling him the same thing happened to my mom oh reall y she was was it hi i dont know she just told me that you know it was a long time ago youre saying f years ago yeah it was around that time and she told me but he used to i dont know uh she she didnt say anything newspaper whatever but he would uh do finish the job oh everythi you know a oh so but she said she reported it and no one ever did anything theyre hard cases um to act on mhm and i think the reason why they finally started acting on these and getting the identificatio mhm was be so many of em were coming in oh okay do you have any questions june no okay u im going to put june on first okay and then then rickie and then will you let us know what the final verdict is yes hm definitely hopefully its good news if its not ill be bummed cause ive been living with this case now for so long am i doing that right so far mhm all the way down to that mhm i think i dont think i am do you and youd have to have that plus or minus what i dont know what i did to ge that where did i get that square root of um ex squa because you brought this over here you brought three over here divided by three and then you have ex squared so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex squared i guess all i cant figure out is what the square root of negative two thir thi two thirds is would that be i s root two i square root two th o over three the whole thing would be over three well no it couldnt be square root of two thirds yeah but then you got the other one nathan oh gosh hm le she snoozing on the floor mhm not anymore you woke her u shes doing the karate kid nathan shes like lea me alo do i deser this i mean how would you like it when youre laying in be somebody just grabbed your arm started swinging it around id probably just slap em ex squared equals one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equal the square root of one shes not even looking at me shes just looking l i know thats what im talking about so would that one be square root of one half mhm it would mhm yep but do yall have to do that um you have to like have it where you do that theres no um fraction under the uh under the in the denominator i mean no fraction under the oh yeah so then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two even f the top one even for that one no for im talking about for this one oh all you do is like go t two over one you have the square root of one like that right mm since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that a square you have to multiply by the square root of two and then you get two and you multiply the top by the square root of two and you get square root of two what i wanna rewind it and hear tha back again cause i sure didnt catch it the first time you got the two and you take the square root of two and you get the negative two which you take the square and it comes to two im sorry so lets talk about this slow as i wr this down as youre saying it alright this is what we came out with right its but put it as the square root of o over the square root of two oh and then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of tw ri uh is that what all those square root of twos are thats what i was try thats what i was trying to say okay i was wondering where all that square root two square root two thats what it was then right here youd get square root of two over two mhm see everything was square root two over two and two right but then what about this one o this o let me do this one but you have i you have i square root of three over square root of three i mean z i square root of two over three square root of three i cant even say it right over do i have another i down here or just the one i um no just one okay three and square root of three over square root of three and you get i square root of six yeah over three is that ri i doubt it i really do im not kidding you cant you cant multiply square roots like that can you square root of two times square root of three is square root of six is it yeah okay well then thats fine then that is right isnt that c you ca do that yeah cause thats the same way youre multiplying there square root of nine that and square root of nine equals three yeah okay wheres the test there aint no telling you have it i mean i have it okay the next one is five ex times ex minus one is that it um equals two times one minus ex le two times one minus ex yeah and thats easy you can do that oh this is easy ex squared please say this will factor will it na you do it well i mean thats just wasting time cause if its no yeah it does mhm one and negative twofifths mhm and i can al put tho back up into the to and and see if they check right let me just try the one fi i got zero equals zero tha thats right and th one yeah zero equals zero equals one okay fingerprint file you got me dow come on ex times hang on number eight ex times two minus ex two minus ex is less than or equal to i dont like these three times ex minus four three times e minus four right alright distribute first right mhm two ex minus ex squa three ex minus tw you get do that side so you get ex whoa i dont want to do that negativ ex squa two ex minus xx two minus ex um plus twelve xxxx now do you factor this after you do that yeah yeah oh but first i gotta take out that negative one dont i mean that negative mhm in front of that ex squared so i just i can multiply that whole side by negative one again though yeah then you flip that sign over i have to flip that sign over if i do that mhm see its little rules like that that im not gonna remember so if its a if its less than or equal to then and theres a minus you have to flip the si okay are you tired n really i mean kind of but im gonna go home in just a few minutes why cause i can work on this at home and let you get some sleep ouch okay s so you say ex plus four is greater than or equal to zero x so you say ex is greater than or equal to negative four a ex three or oh is that one of the ones where you have to do or yeah and if its less tha do you still do or no thats if its um in the in the b in between those two number you know if theres like a like this one dont look but if theres like a ex in the middle well no thats a or if you have like o number on one si mm and it say yes greater than or equal to ex like and than l that ones less than or equal to like two is less than or equal to ex is less than or e to which is xx uh less than or equal to less tha less than or equal to six right so the final ans so thats the answer right mhm number ni okay i dont know this one so you dont know how to do this one so we in trouble well you apparently knew how to do it did i get it right well you didnt get the whole thing right xx but you well you just missed one part of it so whats that p um absolute value okay of onehalf minus ex over three ex over three oops okay is less i mean is greater than or equal to twothirds just plain old twothirds mhm how do you get rid of the absolute value things dont you i dont you put is less than or equal to twothirds or is greater tha i mean is greater than or equal to twothirds and then dont you have like i or is less than a is less than or equal to negative two thirds wh can i see what i did yeah but when you when you have absolute value when you take the absolute value off and you put negative twothirds on this side too first ill just get a common denominator so i can do that you cant do it when its in the absolute value xx though well i did right there is that why i missed it but see if you wanna do that then at first you bring so i only did one part of it in other words mhm just bring nega just bring twothirds over to the other side negative twothirds over to the other side and make it equal to zero no no keep that there but then have another one over there yeah have is less than or equal to negative two thirds and thats not absolute value anymore well see weve never done it like that let me see if thats how you do it i mean im sure you probably can do it that way i dont know if thats how you do it or not cause i havent done this in probably about as long as you have oops god its my own fault i shouldnt have waited so long to get math over with i shouldve g it over with right out right out of high school oo a bu hey le she looks so ti i know shes eating that bu is that what shes doing yuck i guess yeah thats how you do it you can do it that way mhm let me see the pencil but then i didnt get what she got i guess she yeah you can put it so square root of that oh no its not gonna work that way you dont have it in the middle see i put it in the middle seven halves is greater than or equal to but you cant put it in the middle cause if its gonna be g yeah if its gonna be greater than that then its not gonna be less than that well i guess it can god so one way i could do it well s no wait a minute now see l look what she di she u flipped that sign over but uh when she you divide by negative two you have to flip all the signs over which you k did yeah cause you got that right its right here oh go you know what im just gonna skip this one no youre not youre gonna do it now so i cant start by d unhunh not finding a common denominator you have to ha bring well i can do find one side by doing that cant i yeah but why dont you p just put the other put once you have n twothirds on the other side then you can find a common denom f na buh buh buh buh common denominator for the whole thing and its gonna be the same denominat well whats the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh i didnt mean tha i meant once you bring it over there i know what you meant i dont ever remember us doing anything like that though well add it onto the other side theres like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars in problems isnt there hey can i u some of this oh yeah uh_mm see yeah here its absolute values right here and its doing it the way that you were doing it im trying to find one l tha one see thats the problem theres so many different ty that im sitting here st worrying about this one right here and there probably wont even be l one like this on the test i know therell be a different one so what do you do you find a inequality with an absolute value in it which theres one right there mhm see i sure didnt see any in the examples hmm see theres no there it is see here it is absolute value of that you brought uh uh brought negative four over to the other si o and all that see that just proves that she puts problems on there that weve never go over i know weve never done one like that where you do that can you do you wanna do that when its less than or can you do that when its greater than too yeah th either way so if its pointed this way you just put another one pointing this way over here right okay whered you get that one thats a big one youre not kidding x thats my thumbnail now i just get a common denominator for the whole thi mhm well take out those absolute value things theyll screw you up yeah and now thisll be six right is that right mhm now what do you do subtract three from the middle and y to which side to both sides to both sides okay negative xx two ex alright to one then after that you have to take out the negatives yeah divide by well just ta divide by negative two oh you cant get that by xx ex by itself yeah and when you divide by a ne you have to flip the signs yeah okay and when you do that its gonna be a o because if you look at it cause you know it cant be greater than sevenhalves and less than negative halve at the sa onehalf at the same time so its gonna be either ex is less than or equal to negative onehalf or okay will you pass me some of that tea please oh thank you number te how many problems are on this test twelve oh good what did you want to do after this test thats it i guess you gonna study some more tomorrow then right oh definitely okay ex plus four over three ex minus two is less than zero is less than zero right go is this the c is this the same class im taking kathy are you sure were doing work from the same class that im that im that i go to every night i dont know are we its got the same name but thats about it okay i dont even know how you start this one do you yeah i think so but im not sure cause the way i start it do i did i have anything written on the test mm i left it blank but but anyways back to the the first thing okay what we were talking a was yeah ive gotta pick up pat i l i dropped her off at the bookkeeper uh uh i would prefer that that you were there uh on one hand because i think that it would be most expedient but i think what was f was that at this point rather than ha than create i dont really f find it to be you know a confrontation by any means but mhm i just think they wanna be able to just kind of uh figure out i think our board eh quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior than we do outside of it hm i think most of it is just attitudes hm i think uh you know like i said what we need to do is this board has to realize in my opinion that that they have to come to grips with the fact that they are responsible for basically what theyve created mhm okay you know mhm you cant th penalize some for m and the vetters are somewhat responsible thats right and thats uh mhm well it was far beyond our control well and the thing is i mean that uh were were a different board we are not the same yeah and we have to do that thats right but we have to realize that theres the faults here we have to claim responsibilities i mean mhm i think there was theres manners of of speaking that i was very outspoken about at this meeting you know w that i talked to uh bill and carmela and nancy about you know and they x we did they asked me to meet with them about teresas thing mhm that i find v really nothing to be honest nothing of any validity well i you know okay i have spoken twice with teresa did you unhunh yeah and i told her exactly well i t i simply told her what what i know to have happ and i its to me its n just ludicrous and i anyway we w we went through the whole thing and uh and and i also said that it would probably be brought up at b retreat or d_i dont know uh well i im gonna write a letter to teresa uh um just to tell her that l you know d thank you for your l you know y what youve done for the board and so forth mhm and just say you know im hoping we are gonna address this letter of concerns that youve given us mhm um shes asked that you know she want she didnt really want her things to be kind of everywhere you know those th m what her comments she really wanted em to be within this p committee mhm uh my f summar or something like that i guess s they were her summar her summary th you know she kyu very m very concisely yeah i dont know if she put it together or if nancy put it together but m you know that just says uh they i d i really had a ho everybody there including nancy m you know uh had very little to to uh you know to agree with the validity okay yeah it was a matter of i just dont uh you know see where this is coming from yeah its okay you know these are these are roo i know jeez obviously in a personal issue yeah um teresa is a very sensitive person she f you know uh i dont i have no doubt that she believes what happened happened but well but my my feeling is as i told them i said if its that issue i says you know i said lets just get real here i said yeah we all know brad i said we all know teresa i said and i dont know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around teresa period yeah unhunh i says i dont know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature i said a there it was very clear you know she kept saying prefacing everything with you know this is no a personal attack this is no a personal vendetta yeah yeah yeah yeah right right which tells you that it is yeah thats immediately what it said and thats what every perceived it yeah there yeah there have been some uh ill te well it goes back to if you can believe it i ha i know she there was a a we had a number of people once at a party uh like half of the board it was a big mistake of mine yeah and i know she felt really snubbed a uh mhm and it was and i i called her in fact later and i said teresa thi this was not a w i invited people that helped with the market that year mhm i think it was two years ago and i know i mean that wa really upset her and jeez if thats gonna upset her uh well thats thats the thing that but anyway that see and the other thing that ive gotta do too is i wanna make sure like for example donnas awa that she is not gonna be at this retreat m see i have not called her but im gonna call her to tell her that mhm yeah you know were having a board retreat you know r that its not gonna include staff if thats what we decide right unhunh and what we will do is i think what were gonna probably wanna do or what i would like to do is i would like to take a day m d during the week and well just take a whole day that day an myself uh if we have a uh facilitator mhm u that that person you and patricia and uh d donna mhm and maybe one other or two other board members would actually spend that day and just say okay this is what went on at that retreat mhm these are the con yeah these were comments uh these are the ones that we feel we can address these are the ones that pertain to you unhunh yeah uh i i am concerned phil that you mentioned it yesterday that that there may be a number of questions that just cannot be answered without me being there yeah i i i think its hi gato you know im gonna have okay can we talk l uh i bet pats gonna shes gonna start walking back to the office yeah i dropped her at the bookkeeper w w why dont you call me at least a little bit later maybe yeah and we can go do that can i do that cause i shell be ji jim and i are gonna have lunch uh i dont want to get her uh i dont know if you have plans or not but were gonna have lunch later at noon sure if you wanna join us itd be great sure yeah u you wanna do it where whats the i uh you know i dont my my feeling is im trying to i think what i wanna do is my my point of wanting to push this retreat i think it was really important was m to do it to e to make it sound like were taking it seriously oh yeah but to also put into perspective and see w that was one point of view why yeah you know like i said d d the facilitator in in the beginning i did not wasnt really in support of one and only because i felt mhm i wanna make it sound important it would formalize it too much or i want it formalizing it but its also say i want it to come to the resolution that things arent that ba mhm no and that what i what we and things arent that bad the thing is that we h do have our attitudes mhm mhm okay mhm we have an attitude you know even what rays attitude with with barbara mhm is completely unheard of you know and im that bothers me a great deal jeez i just couldnt be that when i heard it i i had you know i came real close to calling ray and just sitting and talking with him about it yeah but i fi no yeah im just gonna blow it off i think hes off the board im gonna blow it off hes im not gonna give m yeah you know weve done everything we needed to do right right i think you know what barbara told me was that dolores was incredibly embarrassed by his display at this time in front of her dolores apolo for ray to him really oh gee so dolores is obviously aware that oh gosh you know and yeah she says i dont know why he resigned i dont know whats got in because hes been miserable because w which w know mhm thats why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound you know like he and n_you know he was trying to make it sound like same old complaint same old everything well we didnt have any complaints yeah i think this is one of the first years i know that this has been so smooth and i think had we realized it mhm we would have allowed him to take a break four years ago yeah yeah yeah because and it wasnt so much it wasnt you know like i told jim i said it wasnt anything that y did wasnt any else mhm i said it was a matter of you know brad did uh and pat did the organization i said which was the best thing i th i agree with that mhm i think that was the best thing to do mhm it was a lot of time yeah but i think we need to we need to d establish duties mhm you know which we decided and see part of what we decided with these duties is just deciding what we need to do what you know theres gonna be tasks mhm as specific as we ca uh yeah see and im im on one hand id like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes un you know pat does that yeah i know theres really the secretary serves almost no function just i th not you know i its just uh there signs she signs her name thirty times yeah you know in the last f y right right phil two days ago well that was it that was it thats a problem that um i you know and i think we wanna do that we need to say you know pats been great enough to do this uh and if she really wa to do it im not gonna uh dissuade her from doing it yeah but one thing we have to be careful of yeah that i mentioned to jim and ive mentioned it to pat l yeah which is to be careful abou saying things you know like in board meetings in interjecting too much yes okay i know because in board discussion i mean yeah o on one hand as a member she has every right to to speak what she wants bu mhm no but thats the thing is you know ive just seen some of the looks from some of the people you know who feel im a board member yeah and whether the board you know if they dont interject anything but whether they do or not i think we have to be careful mhm well phil that i mean that goes be because where that came in that goes for me as well then it yeah it does but it um i think whats different is you um youve been much more re in this sense i mean okay pats more opinionated in that sense you know i unhunh okay i what i try to do is is is just respo to question x and if i need to fill in blanks which oh yeah thats fine you know that but see but that your your position is different m okay thats yeah thats true yours is in a is a much more official capacity because you are the one who answers to the board yeah right you have to do that and you are th ca voice an opinion about things yeah but the biggest deal where i thought it uh was an issue th where i heard things about it was during the annual meeting right after when we had the discussion about the poster oh when we brought up the thing was pat uh pat was right in the middle of it see i i wasnt there and she was saying well this is a great piece and this is this well yeah you know i didnt wanna em her she shouldnt have done that and i didnt wanna do anything i know but i just saw people kinda going that was out yeah you know yeah and thats true she shouldntve been in on that at all she shouldntve been uh you know cause thats not part of her capacity shes not on that com mhm mhm you know and if she wants you know uh basically the thing is you know if she wanted to be a boa person mhm thats fine i mean lets look into b pursuing that right right but see im afraid were gonna lose jim because of that he feels theres a conflict and uh its definitely gonna happen i mean he says theres no question about it weve talked yeah and maybe its right maybe it s it is gonna be right yeah you know well he d i mean he doesnt seem to uh uh youve talked to him and ive talked to him and well he seems to be i mean he says mayb you know after the board retreat now yeah but not well i a you know i wanted him i said i want you to stay through the board retreat yeah i says and the reason is because i said we need people who know i said right now we have you know f new board members or five yeah you know yeah four whatever four new board yeah and were at this point of saying okay uh all of a sudden we have t all these you know questions to answer mhm you know we have all these things that we have to do mhm and we have this commitment of time uh and but they dont know everything thats gone on in the last years they need to be educated as to see this no no this retreat thats why you see i think its important because i mean i realized that id never seen the bylaws since i was on the board until i asked for a copy mhm mhm right yeah now what i what i have done though is to you know any new board member that jumps on i send them good copies of the because i wanna yeah i wanna get these b but ty typically they no one reads em well thats fine you know but its at least theyve got b i think what i wanna do is im gonna i wanna draft a letter mhm like i said which m uh says to them you know this is what were doing this is the purpose of this retreat mhm to new board members and you know board members for a while it was we need to find out what it is were doing yeah whe were doing something right or not you know right right i think we are b but oh yeah sure we are i think sure we are the thing i uh i dont i need to b them to kind of commit to to being responsible mhm yeah and uh i mean i kinda hate to feel like im taking charge but th i guess thats what im im needing to do well yeah for you know but y y you do and youre and thats kind of why im and youre present im going to assign things unhunh you know at some point were gonna ha committees and were gonna have you know mhm b people thatll be given tasks yeah you know specifically yeah like you know i didnt need to do all this calling aro to find a r a r retreat space but i figured if i dont do it thats right its gonna fall on you or pat yeah of course yeah you know and normally thats thats what happens uh thats okay but i mean uh you know i im a im a im aware of a lot of the things that are going on you know yeah i know that youre getting ready to leave and pats doing things so id better let you go get her yeah i know okay and well contin this well yeah there in some manner but we dont have to talk about it at lunch if you dont want but i think no thats fine if we can thats fine if we can go ahead and carry on um at some point you and i i think yeah because one thing that comes to mind is is the well the question of meeting quarterly is that enough meaning having you know the it would be enough if committees were to meet uh uh if committees yeah and thats the but that thats that was pauls uh desire and i think was uh thats what we wanna talk ab well talk about that there too and say look mhm you know is quarterly you know we would we need to meet every other month mhm you know do we need t do we need to meet you know as a full board every oth w we shouldnt have to we shouldnt if the com uh but these committees need to be active function properly and to do their things right basically you know the publications committee needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish yeah you know yeah they need to become somewhat selfsufficient collections committee needs you know i would like to create collections committee to be something where were almost matching yeah uh funds they can raise maybe unhunh yeah you know if they can raise ten grand well you know and have some i mean realistically have some incentive right for them to yeah so that basically theyd be theyd get to a point of saying mhm okay we need to be responsible with this so that collections yeah and publications will be all fund raising too right oh boy phil thats yeah its not gonna be pretty yeah thats where because thats you know also we may consider you know we have one board opening and i we may think about gail well gail is very interested and so is this we met with another person by the name of bill ashby hm yeah i know jack and i and jim met with him oh you mean his jacks financial friend that jacks friend is retired yeah hes a banker yeah and hed be good on one hand but yeah i would like ideally xx id want em both yeah yeah you know and im hoping yeah i what im gonna what im anticipating doing is uh this retreat might urge people to say im not interested in doing that much work yeah and so im getting yeah and it might just f get like nancy and kay i mean i like kay xx see nancy was going off she she told me she was going off this year and she uh and kay convinced said well nancy you cant leave right away and uh uh she said okay ill stay another year but i dont know why you know and and then we can uh why tha i think thats very important to discuss at the board retreat i think it is because i mean the thing is that we need to get to a point and the reason weve set terms is because basically people here mhm majority of us have been here a long time yeah thats right you know and theres a point well thats why we have this the term limitation unhunh xxx im i im uh full agreement cause im ready you know yeah ive a to do this term yeah mhm but mhm my feeling is im ready for a year off yeah you know mhm a ill still be volunteering but i really am ready fo some time to say mhm you know and i wanted jim to consider being market manager even if he goes off the board yeah i know he was wavering a little bit on that whether or not he would volunteer at the marketing center yeah i mean theres uh ive gotta run now o j see you brad um but the lun uh were gonna meet here oh youre gonna have x so we can d either swing by for you or we can decide well call you oh so youre not when i know what were doing if you want okay thatd be great alright xxx talk to you in a bit sam has been has taken such an interest in this retirement bit that it it really surprises me well shes begun to listen yes she has you know she has uh she used to go over and read a book uh_yeah or or something b turn a deaf ear that was for sure bu uh once you understand it you know you you interested in getting right in and going after it yeah i really oughta call at least reg barr and ask if uh hes still speaking to me well now he was the one that was up on the uh left yeah up there yeah yes well he came over to you all smiles i notice n_yes well weve known each other for thirty some years why wouldnt he but a anyway u i was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit because it was bu thats been ob jecting to our having it oh and i knew this so when he opened up on that and she followed through and told about her husband you know not necessarily that she would approve of it but at least she wasnt disapproving yeah of it yeah an uh course duvall might uh and i i cannot get over this that man i really cannot and you know he must have been thinking when he said he wasnt a political appointee he must have been associating his relationship wi steit oh i really do believe that mhm in his thinking i dont know how else he could have done it that topples over um but he didnt say that oh he said i loved your uh hum humor uh and i love you but i am no a political appointee and his eyes were just snapping and i said oh how did you get on the board well he said i got a letter from the gover asking every on there is an app political appointee that wasnt the p the point wa i could have mentioned what was in the paper about hi that he was related uh you know had business with steitler and i just said and theres doctor duvall you know and then i went to rotus whos a seasoned pol yeah if there ever was one he just would flare and i said well i alrigh i said ill apologize next time uh and im gonna make hay out of it dont you worry i wanna know how you birds got on that board if youre not political app mm oh my can i grow some basil from seed yes thats how ive i dont have any this year but ive grown it other years well theres no problem it will not take any frost soon as the b yeah i a little bit of frost its gone i l i learned that one time the i learned it just went down the hard way hm uh huh yes well i think it was barbara that has some seeds just no problem it comes right up yeah yeah isnt that what you gave the neighbor one time i you gave him some kind of herb did i give him some i gave him a red pepper i think you i think you gave him some herb of some kind i may have given given him some basil yes yeah i dont have any this year i forgot to plant it i have oregano yeah a good stand of it if you want any yeah i have a lot of dried or oregano x is your cigarette out everybodys yeah its out you smoked it down into the cork didnt you pardon you smoked it down into the cork well yeah you dont like that do you but no it chokes me to death its its there might as well smoke it oh no good no good uh hows ted doing hes uh keeping very busy hes on mostly uh evening hours mhm theyre redoing the pharmacy there at wel wallmart oh enlarging it a well its close to the garden shop and so the f in the garden shop and the pet shop have to move things out from that area oh into the garden shop so they can work on the pharmacy well they needed to expand the pharmacy ive never been there but what i had to wait and wait and wait so i dont where are they putting the pharma well theyre b leaving it in the same place theyre just taking out two rows of of uh s where the toiletries were yeah just inventory stuff moving it uh uh theyre theyre moving that i dont know where where theyre going to put all that hm but ted says theres not much garden left just all of this stuff out in there he works uh six days next week instead of five days x he only gets one day off hm m hes off today mhm and uh well but he hasnt had day hours hes been working evening hours and weekends you know i think id hate to be in business right now oo you cant sit still hmm you have to expand or something to keep in the main stream well and so many times when they expand theyve expanded and then things dropped back yeah but this wallmart needs uh needs a larger building yeah its just too cramped your shirt and beads are most becoming well you know i think they weigh about a quarter of an ounce and thats the right kind of beads unhunh for summer a little girl the other day remarked about them and almost on impulse but i didnt do it i thought id pull em off just give em to her if she liked em that well you know but then i thought these are the only summer beads i ha right and i like i like that b shirt you know what i had to do this what did you this see where i sewed right down the middle of that yeah otherwise it would balloo out and so i s put it on the machine and sewed right down through the middle of it so it doesnt gap so it d doesnt gap right oh smart yeah well it works smart it had a it had a one of tho bottoms that oh are what do you call it a tail no the tight it uh uh the band oh the t the tight band around the bottom of it b band i dont like those i dont either makes your butt look thin most all of em are that way makes your hei and do you know makes your heinie look thinner i went over to a store where it says uh sewing alterations and all that stuff and i said how much do you charge for taking that bottom band off the top you know and just making it a straight shirt and she said eight dollars and i thought oh my lord i didnt pay that much for the top ive got on you know thats a little like these catalog things i saw something in a cat the catalog this uspe deal that ive been with for a long time and i wanted to buy it it was a m m like a muumuu mhm werent those pretty ones up in dillards the other day those muumuus did you notice em didnt you notice em as you went out all beautiful colors so pretty well anyway they were on the rack and uh i wanted to order that muumuu i mean it was around twentynine dollars or something like that and two pairs of short pajamas one for sam and one for me a i looked at the postage attached to it and i thought good heavens it would have been around eight dollar its by amounts of money not weight its by money how much m this costs and its geared according to that and i thought uh forget it i could take that eight dollars and buy another whole outfit yeah you know this is amazing uh i like to get um pillow covers that you zip on to protect the pillows mhm mhm and uh i went over to sears one time and or three through the catalog and instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything i paid postage on it separate yeah and do you know the postage came to more than the g than the product more than the product right right well i i w uh thats one of the letters that im going to write to uspe and just tell them that theyre g this in the wrong way it should be geared according to weight now that g cotton two pairs of cotton pajamas and that cotton muumuu aint gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth believe you me i wouldnt think no i know better so i thought th i just wont order from em i m thats foolish we better go up to dillards and see if they still have those muumuus you mean up to phoenix no well they might have them here in town i dont know at dillards they they were sure pretty pretty c pretty colors some of em were dark yeah yeah but they had oh purples and uh r and pinks and oh pretty designs in em hm you didnt see em i dont think i was i was i think i was concerned about your getting there and back oh oh hunh youre not the only one baby you werent the only one sam i was just dripping i was just soaked buckets i was just absolutely soaked wasnt i yeah she c came in and sat down in the rest you know and spent the first ten or fif min uh stopping the flow of trickling down her neck oh oh terrible just terrible oh well i my other do does the same thing oh does she x yeah well what is it i dont know she does know well some people just perspire well i didnt persp use to perspire like that more but i sure have done it no not to that ex you didnt recently uh th that and the time we were up in uh m montgomery wards re oh ye oh boy was i soaked that was just and that was in the winter weakness exertion well maybe thats what this was but anyway i wish the stores would open earlier ear yes i do too instead of ten oclock in the summer they oughta open at least at nine well it would he id say eight uh it would help eight oclock would be fine you hate to start out at ten o id say eight and quit at four you know the little folks who live above me mhm go over to tucson mall and walk every morning yeah thats good and theres a side door mhm unlocked so that they can go in oh i think a lotta people do that they go r uh at least by eight oclock yeah and they go i they go in and walk and then they know x so many times around you know mhm mhm will um make a mile and then theres a soft drink place up there that they all congregate oh and uh why dont you join em and they have pi when they cover fifty miles or whatever you know yeah and a hun miles of what out is this from oasis no no its a its just a neighborhood thing its just people around in that area its n and they go there to walk i think i think thats it but uh i uh weve been over there and weve seen em go in and all theyre doing is just walking mhm they might be good people we could cultivate to hunt things for us yeah you mean look in the window now thats thats an idea instead of having to parade all around looking for it theyre around why not tell us where that is well yeah well they can explain and they can take no as they go arou uh of cour make it pay off be glad to shop for you charge a fee right uh i still havent found anybody that wants to let me pay a little fee and then call em every morning that im up and around what what what w back up a minute do what i youll pay to be called ive been looking for somebody who will sit by the phone in the morning and a and clients will call in and say good morning im up and so th theyre through for the day then im up if i dont call in by say nine oclock then well ill be glad to do that for a fee you will how much is the fee though angela i dont m it does that b does it really bother you id like to have somebody i could call in to every morning

did s call out last night and say l uh make a note for potassium though do you have one of those little things that has a compartment in it for each day no no heaven sakes im not a very good pill taker im re i think im resenting im not either but i have im re this medicine and i think its contributing to my problems i really do i think that the cardazam is i think that the d diarrhetic is uh well now your your ankles were down this morning and your legs well yes they are they were now look at em now theyre s tight again oh did i tell you no what that that the spring broke in my recli oh yes oh yes youve told us that and dorsens fixed it you got it fixed up and and two men came in and wrestled it all over the floor and they found out that it was easier they went back out the truck and got a g a whole assembly for one side the the the mhm you know makes the xx was this on the seat or the back makes the feet go out the the the f the footrest goes out you know theres a uh a a mechanism there yeah so they put a whole new mechanism in on side hm and i wasnt prepared for them to i was going to tip them but i wasnt prepared to b buy the chair over again s so no i gave em ten dollars but thats all i had well that was enough i guess that was enough i xx theyre on salary with the c with the company any yeah sure but they were so jovial a yeah was that spring from your seat or the back of th your chair nice now it was a a tight little spring that um governed the mechanism and held the chair together when you put out oh the footrest the foot rest and i told well i think i told you this i phoned her and said i dont know whether i can sit in the chair at a or not and i said and besides when i go by it it snarls at me and and she sh she said well its alright to sit on it but dont put the footrest out what else politics deals with the question of power right thats the introduction to empowerment what is power very quickly come on all of you should know these two concepts theyre not that difficult what is power what are we talking about having the capacity to impact public policy alright so if were talking about politics politics is tied into the whole concept of power right and if were talking about empowerment as a concept we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power now does power come in one form does it come in many different forms different different forms back here what forms give me examples of power either one of you education know alright knowledge knowledge montoya okay what else u money u your position in the workforce u okay im trying to think of the word alright close right wealth num wealth numbers of people numbers of people right what else social status social status position right if youre the chairperson of u a major corporation would you say that that person has some power most definitely alright especially if youre in uh ibm or general motors or chrysler corporation and i think in some some t some examples some gender and race can give you power gender race alright gender lets deal with that alright gender race lets talk about race in terms of power i i make the statement which i di that theres no fear factor when it comes to the chicanolatino community and there is much more of a fear factor in dealing with the africanamerican community am i not dealing with a racial factor of power yes sure why because its gonna affect the decision making process the politics and um the policy alright africa i u i kinda like in pas africanamericans have been more organized and have had more leaders or not more leaders but who have more leaders whove been kn or something more recognized like martin luther king thats right yeah more rec and alright i think thats a fear factor xx that is a part of the fear factor mhm i mean uh if one looks at what uh jesse jackson is doing vis a vis who the major league baseball teams and all that football and all that whats his underlying argument whats his criticism that therere not sufficient numbers of what blacks well he says minorities hes smart hes talks about minorities but hes really talking about africanamericans in the uh managerial process of right of professional sports exactly managerial owners managers et cetera right alright have you heard of a latino say this or would a xxx jesse jackson have said that about latinos hm no unhunh we havent and uh were gonna get into that in our discussion alright so the whole notion of power is very important to understand because here i am making some statements alright some generalities that some people would say are not true i mean how can doctor montoya say that latinos have no no real power no fear factor after all they have two people that are cabinet members they have supervisor here in los angeles they have city council people in los angeles and yet hes saying that they have no power well power is relative as well right its relative its relational power is relational how can you measure power power is impossible to measure alright in other words you cannot break power apart into vi various ingredients and say a b c d these are the ingredients of power we can make generalities position wealth all these different things that ive talked about but power is difficult to measure so that we must deal with the whole question of empowerment from also the perspective of potential power versus actual power there is a difference if i am for example the president of a major labor union or a major corporation the position as president of that entity gives me so much power but yet if i do not know how to utili that entity in terms of its mobilization for a given objective like a labor union if i have fourteen million people as members and i dont show any manifestation of power am i powerful well it has to be measured by what youre trying to do what the objectives are example l today is being challenged by perhaps one of the most serious pieces of not legislation per se because its not in a legislative form yet but a proposed north american free trade agreement that if passed by congress is going to impact three economies canada u_s and mexico l as a sector is going to be the most impacted how is labor today mobilizing its great power uh not just the aflcio and its fourteen million members but the united auto workers and many other or labor organizations what are they doing to influence public policy combining power huh theyre combining their power how are they combining their power by al allying with other um unions of workers alright theyre theyre theyre forming coalitions among themselves theyre forming coalitions with who environmental groups right cause environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted especially along the border alright so theres theres a lot of coalition building but can you say as a historian that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago taking to the streets no no theyve definitely lost power alright good point they have he said they have lost power so your measurement of a loss of power is based on what what they can and cant x alright alright you dont see what youve read about right right today alright thats one perception is the black community less powerful today in nineteenninetythree than it wa in nineteen sixty eight with the poor peoples march on washington or nineteensixtythree again on the w uh march uh to washington on washington when martin luther king gave his famous speech i have a dream there were three hundred thousand people at that march in nineteensixtythree which period of time historically speaking was a time where blacks were manifesting much more power today or nineteensixtythree or nineteensixtyeight when when they m manifest theyre beginning to get more power uh when uh in in comp in in now when do uh make a comparison nineteenninetythree nineteensixtyeight nineteensixtythree during those three periods when would you say blacks demonstrated much more power now they have more power now they have more power why do you say that cause theyre more recognized i mean does recognition give you power hm yeah to a to some aspects yeah i think i think the the problem with your question is s a different sort of powers ah very good explain that you have uh you have africanamericans more institutionalized in our system now ah than they were in six alright stop right there today they have how many congressmen thirty eight thirty eight congressional representatives i dont know how many they had in nineteensixtythree im not even gonna try to guess but uh probably no more than two or three if they were lucky alright would you say that i would say thats right alright go on what else i sixtyeight the blacks were a whole lot more mobile mobilized much better mobilized threehundredthousand marching on washington is an example you probably couldnt get that today okay alright you know with chicanos the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteenseventy during the era of the vietnam w twentyfivethousand chicanos were mobilized in los angeles a at the national chicano moratorium against the war no one has come even close with the exception of the death of cesar chavez recently where there were approximately fortythousand people to mobilize large numbers of people into some kind of a effort or movement alright so hes correct it depends on the time depends on the circumstances and the form of power institutionalized power is different from the unconventional form that uh y you just described alright well what were trying to get at is potential versus actual my argument as humble as it is is that chicanos in nineteenninetythree are fast developing a high potential for power but theyre a long way from actualizing their true power okay in other words theyre were still at the potential phase of our empowerment and not at the actual power phase alright anything else on those two concepts alright lets get into discussion on voter participation and these are kind of general comments i dont have the time to give you a lot of statistics but ill give you some general uh trends some statistical information that will prove a point that will introduce the subject of political participation in the united states now a democracy the participation of the citizenry is imperative it is absolutely imperative if its to be a democracy to have the people participate now what am i trying to say what am i trying to say it is imperative for the people to participate in the political process another way of saying it what am i saying we have to vote everyone but why is it important in a democracy for the people to participate just deal with the question not the methods you mean becaus if the people dont v it will be there will be an elite group itll be m of a m that has control it wont be a democracy okay whats a monarchy kings one ruler well one royalty what one ruler royalty or one family xxxx alright close theres a royal type of family right king yeah not elected alright hereditary et cetera et cetera alright but what am i getting at w whats the essence of what im asking for yes fire away by its very nature democracy demands voting without vo xx ah stop right there you made a statement by the very nature of democracy what is a democracy democracy is rule by the people alright demos cratos right people rule xx another greek word the greeks were major contributors to this political process of development of concepts demos cratos people govern or people rule alright we tell the world that democracy is what we practice is that correct is that what we tell the world yeah yes alright would you agree with that okay what else do we say selling our political system in selling our political system we make it synonymous synonymous by saying that we dont distinguish the form of economic system versus the political system and that we put it in the same kettle democracy and capitalism are essentially the same are they the same no no but yet we do a if we listen carefully and read carefully a these books on international relations foreign relations and so forth what is it that we tell the world that america is the cradle of democracy we are the cradle of democracy we are the bastion of the free world et cetera et cetera et cetera and when ronald reagan was in power we talked about the evil empire right categorizing uh the soviet union and the socalled communist empire as a evil empire alright i say this because there is a tendency for some of us to believe because we have been conditioned right who conditions us to think the way we think what did we deci what did we say earlier talking about culture um they learn through schools through their families schools right schools the media everything else i mean doesnt the media tell us that theres only a twoparty system in this country mhm mhm why is it that the communist party the socialist workers party the prohibitionist party the american independent party all these parties that we have supposedly minority parties dont get the same kind of treatment as the democratic and republican parties theyre not mainstream right we have a twoparty system we are taught from the very beginning that theres only two parties thats a l different subject but im what im the point im trying to make is that if we look into the realities of what we have as a political system we tell the world that in this country democracy is very much alive because we ha a congress we have a supreme court we have a presidency we have a political system that i governed by certain principles and law that emanate from what the constitution which is a living document the constitution right that is very much the document that protects conceptually and otherwise our way of life our democracy and so forth well if we remember our chicano history my point as we get into the whole question of chicano political participation is that its difficult for us as chicanos as we get into it to understand why is it including ourselves because a lot of chicanos dont even understand why we dont vote why dont we participate and they come up with all kinds of somewhat superficial analysis that m of our political behavior is a product of what was covered in this class under history and culture and what did i say two major currents of history two major currents of political culture right and what is political culture ill get back to that concept but just general terms what is political culture what is political culture alright i want you to think put that concept down because youre gonna youre gonna hear about it in the next few minutes its very important that you understand that concept political culture but i want thing i want to underline here is that we are products of a historical dualistic process mexicos history us history were a pr were products of what a cultural process thats also mexican and american whatever american means alright so those two major ingredients have molded the rationale that im using in this class to explain why is it that were still at the potential phase of empowerment and we still have a long ways to go before we realize that concept that i describe called empowerment but before we get into that s substance of that is that i wanna just briefly cover that even though im saying that chicanos do not vote in great numbers and we dont participate in many organizations in great numbers the fact is as i mentioned earlier that even though we tell the world we are this beacon of light of freedom of liberty justice and all these different things by and large not a lot of people participate politically across the board i dont care if youre africanamerican i dont care if youre asianamerican and i dont care if youre latino or whatever most americans do not vote in great numbers so its a double whammy introducing the subject matter here americans in comparison to great britain in comparison to france in comparison to germany in comparison to italy we dont vote in the numbers that they do alright i mean if we had more time i could give you statistic after statistic italy for example ha a voter turnout of ninety percent of those that are eligible to vote were lucky if we get fifty percent are we less democratic are they more democratic why is it that italy has a much larger a higher voter level of participation or germany or even canada seventy percent the fact is that democracy in this country is dying i want you to put that down cause its gonna be important at least for my analysis i dont want you to agree or disagree at this point just write it down you have plenty of time one week to think about it american democracy is dying i want you to put that who phrase in black and white american democracy is dying and i want you to try to think of why as we get into the discussion of chicano participation and well get back to that statement next week so for us as chicanos its a double jeopardy thats another point i wanna underscore because if the larger general population doesnt vote in great numbers when youre at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole and youre at the bottom youre at the very bottom with all the problems of poverty and all the social problems that were weve been talking about its understandable why perhaps chicanos do not vote or participate in great numbers now the literature in political science dealing with factors influence influencing voting are many are many civic culture almond and verba nineteenseventytwo or so is one book that you can look at u theres a book by raymond wolfinger steven ronsteen ronstone im sorry who votes thats another book okay the literature goes on and on but all i want to do in terms of just giving you some idea of what are the factors that influence peoples participation in the political process of this country and there are essentially five you can probably develop more but these are general categories most of the literature in political science and i think mister verba would agree with me on this that people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty what does that mean a sense of duty they regard participation as important now why would you say that this is a factor that influences voting now this is a very somewhat altruistic uh value right a sense of duty why why would you say that people in this country have a some people that vote vote because they have a s of duty why right here i dont know probably it stems m from your education your childhood when your told uh youre an american citizen and its your civic duty you know towards other people a you know getting the government going to vote a put you two cents in because without you then y we wont have government same sense of jury duty too jury okay good point duty as we go through some of these these five i want you to think of the agents of socialization because then i want you to think when we get into the discussion on chicanos how do those agents affect us as chicanos alright number one sense of duty who is responsible for inculcating that sense of duty one the family alright remember the family is your primary agent two the educational institutions i mean from the time that you start kindergarten to the time that you graduate from the university its constant not constant but somewhat of a consistent bombardment of values attitudes et cetera reinforcing the nature of the political system and the virtues of participating in the political process so in essence what im saying is you acquire this through the socialization process that weve discussed already yes i think that its more eyeopening to see that this doesnt exist more than it does and thats why people dont vote it seems that i mean you talk to people they have an attitude i cant make a difference thats why i dont vote its not my responsibility thats why i dont vote theres not a sense of duty even though like you said from the beginning supposedly were getting it all through school why do you suppose that has changed and this is a much of a recent phenomena much more because youve had declining voter participation levels since the nineteenseventies and im giving you the answer wa what what what has been the problem contributing to what you just said well i agree i agree with what he was saying but i think m maybe one of the reasons could be theyre not being represented they dont think theyre being represented they dont um see any like direct results for them you know coming out of like mhm the representation the government and whos in control okay i think i i n thats you know there are a lot of people sure alright i mean thats would you agree with that a lot of people mhm they vote their pocketbook sure they theyre they vote their pocketbook uh they vote definitely their pocketbook alright thats true what would you add to f well you say were not represented its like we say theres not much choice between say like the last um you know you voted for clinton or you know you know whatever his name was bush xx yeah bush in a bush x no i dont think the other guy i dont think theres as much trust oh perot xx trust trust in the system why a lot more corruption i mean you had nixon why to watergate what did you have in the seventies now l lets talk about that what what did what did what did we have okay you well in the beginning well even in the late sixties you had vietnam you had uh good excellent what did vietnam do uh turned uh the youth especially against the government policies the educated youth more so and those were i think the people that were gonna be voting as they went on they lost faith in the system they lost faith in thei leaders alright alright on that score would you say that most of you without getting personal here are products uh in terms of birth of the sixties all of you were born in the sixties early seventies right so that means that most of your parents were very much a part of the era of the sixties right alright would you say go back to you that your parents were very much influenced by the vietnam war one way or the other yeah which which way which direction um total apathy total apa yeah why um well my mom total apathy uh she just i th i dont know i think she just got burned out she got sick and tired of you know turning on the news and seeing another corrupt man or another you know another scandal breaking out she knew friends that were dying in viet you know she had friends that were drafted xx were sent were dying and she didnt you know she didnt believe in the system and she just didnt care anymore i think it was just a lot of negatives had built up okay and she just let it go okay how about you how about your parents u well my dad was drafted he was in vietnam u long story he didnt make it to vietnam but u but he was in the military during that time he was in the military at the time alright yeah okay my mom claims she was too young to know but i dont know okay um i dont know how my dad r felt about it i know we come from a long line of military men so he kind of felt a sense of duty so uh um was there a sense of betrayal possibly yeah mhm x okay who else who wants who else wants to share something here about what were trying to say is that just carbonated water no thank you no no this is crea soda its cream soda oh boy the best its the best im s does it look like cream soda why do these ca get so warped only the only the sams club cans get so warped uh

put it back up there has a homing device homing devi homing device fleck up gross fleck up what did you say kendie gross gross gross she said gross well well anyway okay one large loan renewed a hundred ninetyseven thousand a hundred eighty dollars its on gerald and pamela o theyve pai theyve reduced no problem hes handled his line of credit as agreed so its pretty routine joe okay first loan request i have is an existing real estate mortgage that will be refinanced into the secondary market of fannie mae customer is gerry and pamela tucker at sixtyone fiftyeight main street in hillsdale illinois theyre requesting eightyfour thousand dollars on a thirtyyear fannie mae fixed rate loan this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal title work and points eightyfour eighty four even their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance would be seven sixtyone eightynine based at the current thirtyyear rate they estimate the value of their home to be onehundred and ten thousand dollars we had an appraisal in nineteen ninetyone by a certified appraiser that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars eighty percent of that would make it eightytwo four so u in order to make them a loan for eightyfour thousand it m appraise for a hundred and five so that will be will determine whether or not we can go the full eightyfour and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket their assets total one sixteen four seventeen their liabilities eighty three their net worth thirtyone so all they owe is the house mhm they um t t t currently have a debt to income of twentyeight over twentyseven and after the refinance they would have a debt to income of fifteen over twentythree where are they now i missed that theyre fifteen over no theyre currently twenty they cant be ove r twentyseven i oh okay twenty yeah twenty over twentyseven yeah you cant even twenty over tw xxxx you cant even read your writing i couldnt even read my f my own writing its twenty over twentyseven okay and after the refi its fifteen over twentythree what is acceptable pretty much uh what figures twentyeight over thirtysix is the maxe i as high as it could go see so theyre well within okay i just wondered theyre well within their debt to income i always heard the figures and never did know what was high and right low dont make any difference yeah um so you said theyre gonna be fifteen mhm fifteen over twentythree so their debt to income isnt a problem the uh problem as i see it is the value of the house number one and the second matter at hand is that in nineteen eightyseven they had filed a chapter eleven they had at the time a mortgage with us they reaffirmed on that mortgage they were never late we uh after that discharge we even advanced them money to purchase this house on main st street here in hillsdale and um they have never missed a payment on that loan ive also made them car loans that theyve never missed a payment on a um according to fannie mae guidelines as long as they have been discharged at least two years and reestablished and paid as agreed their credit obligations they would qualify for a fannie mae mortgage with that in mind u i am moving that they app uh that we approve this loan request subject to a uh certified appraisal of their home do we have the discharge yes i have a copy of it mhm when was it it was discharged on november uh no two twentythree eightyeight discharge date was two twentythree of eightyeight when did they file didnt you say they filed in eightyseven eleven of eighty in eleven mhm three months whew thats pretty fast yeah what did they do dis it it was a business no it was a business uh bankruptcy and it was pretty cut and dried they jus were eliminating the business um debt and apparently nobody objected to the the bankruptcy since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors all the debt that was charged that was bank filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors and they discharged em before they even performed or anything yeah in a three mon i guess so in a p threemonth period of time cause heres the no i i just its unusual that they dont require em to you know usually they put em on a twoyear or threeyear plan or some m see the from what i uh i gathered is the unsecured creditors got nothing and the secured creditors just carried on their payment history as agreed as originally set forth in their contracts but you know usually the planll provide some period of time of protection oh i yeah mhm but if weve got uh for those unse creditors yeah but if weve got the discharge yeah okay well in that case thats hard to believe because it says that notice of joint discharge of joint debtors it it appears the persons named above filed a petition commencing yeah joint case under title eleven mhm on november twentythird of nineteen eightyseven a that an order of relief has been entered no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed within the time fixed by the court yeah yeah uh what was that ten minutes or yeah and um yeah see i dont know how they got it done that fast and and that theyre um hell we cant even get to court in three months i know hm thats ridic that i have a lean and its da february twentythird nineteen eighty mhm okay thats uh i mean three months thats all i just yeah thats what i was just i assumed it wouldve been like eighty uh ninetytwo or something mhm you know yeah what the five what actually happened to them was she opened a franchise a it was a franchise of doing packaging sending m uh from a mall basis unhunh uh packaging gift wrapping and ship shipping it well what hap they should have gotten into the business hindsights twenty twenty they shouldve gotten into the business in lets say august a then they wouldve had a christmas season there was a t it got to be real complicated and they didnt get in until february well february they had nothing to do and and i think they yeah they hung in there for a year and a half and they just couldnt couldnt see end to it xx february nobodys shipping anything ill s ill second then joe okay so its moved and seconded to uh approve that loan subject to the uh appraisal by a certified appraisal and the max is eightyfour mhm okay okay all in favor aye aye aye aye opposed same sign motion carries is that the only one thats the only loan i have okay i got one small one the only reason its in here is because the borrowers already ha threehundred three thousand borrowed so it has to be approved by the board but if we if jim and kurt approve it today thatd be two and then ill have to call two more uh they wanna borrow f f well dave wants to borrow fortyfive hundred dollars to finish paying off the renovation and upgrade necessary o the daycare a he had initially thought what he borrowed would do it and then he borrowed some money from his uncle and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way he wants to set it up on a year uh it would be secured via three vehicles u you know his debt to income is relatively high but his incomes going up the daycare is scheduled to open a week after the fifth so around the twelfth to fifteenth of january he thought hes been he thought he was already opened and then they came back in and told him he couldnt open cause there was articles in the paper and they showed kids at the daycare and he had his ads out and everything but he didnt have all the is dotted and ts crossed and state came back in and said we no you cant really do that so one group of state people the people that do all the do the testing for electrical and safety and stuff have been there and now the state inspectors got to come in i guess they just look at the quality of the facility not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating but is it clean and is it safe and that sort of thing theyre supposed to be there the fifth and he said that the lady told him that it usually takes a week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back so he anticipates that theyll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth he gave me some numbers i cant remember theyve got like thirteen or fourteen kids theyre already taking care of mostly out of their house until they can get em moved down there and then theyve got eight or nine more so they fully expect income to exceed the projection but right now they dont have any income other than from his job so uh xxx thats fairly large scale what and hes gonna have twenty people the building is or something yeah at l east twenty children yeah twentyfive see theyre e yeah theyre expecting that many f quickly and then he hopes to get up around fifty see theyre looking at four people plus ive gone through the build you know plus his wife and it is uh a r very very nicely done operation i mean theres nothing shoddy about the workmanship or the quality of the material or the cleanliness of the of the building xx is it at onto a storage facility no its a separate building oh its freestanding building yeah separate building see its a they its a building his dad had where he was where he had his his cabinet sh o shop and okay and was living in it and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing its like anything when youre dealing with th you know regulators and the state they you know he said they got two ladies for nine counties and they theres a lot of this going on and they can only get to so many so i would mo since its secured for fortyfive hundred its on a twelvemonth repayment which is relatively short i would move that we advance the funds ill second it except they owe pretty much dont they threehundred three thousand and some odd dollars but hes always serviced i mean hes never been late hes always paid as agreed uh and they do have the income it just right now the income doesnt well i say they have it o the daycare gets up to twenty people theyll have enough inc to mhm theyll fall back under the forty percent but right now theyre over the forty because we st cant show any income from the daycare um but you know it it you know i feel comfortable that its there and like i say hes always serviced debt as agreed and and his overall debt is working down its just quite a bit of debt you just i guess you cant say too much if theyre paying on time uh uh yeah and and i think theyre about to the point as long as everything works out good yeah i think if th you know th th hes already talking if this thing goes like they think it is next fall hes wanting to start looking at expanding that storage facility its one of those things i think theres theyre always gonna have quite a bit of debt so long as cash flowll keep up with it cause you know hes thats kind of their you know hes looking at that as his retirement income and an investment and this whole bit you know like some of the people do here uh well its been moved and seconded um to approve but that uh we cant really disburse on that that due to his size of the loan until we have all they need f f all the board members majority of board member yeah four uh f at least two more board members because im voting yeah all in im voting in favor of it in favor and yeah see i was since you sec it i assume so are you yeah yeah so see ive got two and then ill try to ill get hold of two more i was gonna see wilbur but he didnt s dave didnt get in here until after he was gone so thats the only one i have any other loans no other loans to be discussed i got a couple things here but uh well um the one is in regard to the retail nondeposit investment just to kind of bring us up to speed m m has tentatively accepted our offer for employment but since hes going to be a dual employee th you really dont need to put this in the minutes xx hm okay ill ill c ill catch up the board up to speed i just want us to know because it has some loan relevance uh he was interviewed by lcl larry harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday and larry called me this morning thats who had called about seventhirty and said everything went fine u what what we have set up is matts going up to chicago at lcls office on uh for monday evening tuesday and wednesday training the f the monday evening and tuesday training will be very specific for him their workflow their forms hell get to meet these people on wednesday then hell be in a little bit of a larger group there may be four or five other asset managers with him discussing sails motivations and and and sales approaches and strategies uh larry said ph he doesnt know how matts gonna plug into us philosophically and how well hes known in the area he said thats our decision of which i you know im comfortable with i wanted larry to tell me how he thinks hes gonna do plugging into the selling and he said oh you he should be he should do very well so i im um tho that looks good what i did kind of in regard to that was and i dont have this date finalized but s im trying to go maybe the second week of january to ha a representative of bankers systems come here to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area matt needs matt needs an understanding of not a detailed understanding but how all these qualified plans work so that he w can have so he understands how his products plug into the to the selfdirected iras seps and the like we also it would do us good to know what products we can offer under those qualified retirement plans so uh r ray galino i i believe is his name is supposed to come down i havent set up a date but hell be here on a f for a day and i wanted him to talk with matt vivian myself and sometime during the day to the two of you because as loan officers you have a good handle on borrowers and and can kind of tell them of these seps and some of the other products uh weve kind of hesitated in in offering those well we have not offered the selfdirected hm offering the selfdirected were getting is simply we need to get a dif fifty different forms instead of called an ira its called an ira sd for selfdirected and then that will allow people to if they dont want all their funds in a bank cd as as are custodial ira arrangements see the existing ira says all those funds have to be in first national bank of hillsdale the selfdirected the the participant signs a an investment direction or where where he directs the investments they sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to yeah xx xxx uh the what how that works like with the seps the sep has a vehicle has to be connected to the ira so we take the sep off the shelf and then if the person wants that money put into a bank cd then we just use our custodial ira forms if they want a selfdirected i sep you take the same sep form off but youre using a different ira youre not using the custodial ira arrangement oh okay uh an sep must have an ira attached to it so that so the iras all fit in the same plan theyre just different ch boxes checked off of this overall plan and that the overall plan is what youre talking about goes back thats what the irs has blessed right they is the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination youre okay exactly so i i had talked with with rick uh brady today and hes gonna send me those forms so we can take a look at em the other the thing which makes it a little more complicated but its really not a cost its kind of a s flipflop in that he recommended we dont try and do the account maintenance on those selfdirected iras ourselves because of how complicated the law is in all this mhm so mhm i mean coincidentally banker systems offers a comprehensive account maintainance services youre kidding isnt that xx well is that a surpri that thats such a surprise yeah and what what what we would do is they would take care of the account maintainance in a similar manner if you will a they take care of the the other qualified plans mhm we they we send them the information th but they print it and they they crank out the numbers qualify it and and and they file whatever needs to be filed disclose it mhm the its really not gonna cost us it its gonna be pretty much of a swap right now we use their eighthundred number a their uh fi their newsletter for the iras we dont have their comprehensive service we have their ira service and that runs about threehundred dollars a year if you go to the comprehensive account maintenance the eighthundred number is included and the f and the newsletter is included so we would drop threehundred dollars off the account maintenance comprehensive account maintenance maintenance would cost us fivehundred dollars but what you do is they he estimates itd be fivehundred dollars for a minimal number of accounts banker system charges thirtyfive dollars an account and he said under a selfdirected arrangement hes seen charges to maintain a selfdirected ira anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollars now i think a hundred fifty dollars is a lot to maintain a selfdirected ira mhm so you mean uh that you w could pass that back to the customer thats what youre saying right right we they charge us fivehundred plus thirtyfive per account well he he thought hes gonna send me down the information you know how the typical salesman they they they d talk in kind of nebulous terms yeah but he thought okay w they they have a minimum number of accounts uh oh with w is covered if you will by the five yes okay and so he said uh uh uh way i understood it would lets say fivehundred would would cover the eighthundred which is very very helpful service mhm and uh the maintenance for lets say twenty accounts well if we had ten accounts okay we would charge uh fivehundred fifty dollars on ac on an account it would be fivehundred dollars its really kind of a switch around but what what that would i think it would be good for the five or six of us to to have galino down here can kind of explain what products we can offer from the bank side hm matt needs to know that and and we all need to know that and then we can figure out how matts the products that lcls gonna offer will plug into that and its i was thinking of sending matt up there for a week but you know hes up there a week hes gonna learn a lot of very technical information such as like those section fourfifteen xses that that i was talking about you really dont need to know the the technical nittygritty about it because thats what bankers systems does they take care of the nittygritty hm so its gonna be less expensive to have galino come here instead of one person going up to to minnesota for a week and then trying to bring back the information were gonna have galino come down here for a day and he wont he wont touch any specific complicated items such as fourfifteen xses or or acp testing or that cause vivian and i kind of know that but if we dont know that like that fourfifteen uh xs mhm i called the eighthundred number and and they went through the explanation where the irs changed the the deduction just a just a question from a mechanics whos gonna ho the account is lcl gonna hold the account is the bank gonna ho hold the account who act you know youre talking about bank products and and lcl products like before the trust department if you will held the account that thats physically where it was mhm you know is is its i uh is the plan uh uh gonna be in the bank or will the plan be in lcl or is the plan uh just kind of nebulous well well the the sep and the ira will will be first national bank of hillsdale okay thats what i meant but but tho those theyre bank products if you will we offer those and then lcl if w have within that plan theyll have things you can buy if you want to direct it that way if you dont want a cd tha the or if you want something else you could direct that that the monies be used to buy some mutual fund or some bond fund or something right and how i envision that then okay we would get the statement from lcl for the mutual fund holdings lets say the person also had a cd okay mhm lets you know it doesnt matter how they split it like we do now and then then what what we would have to do is pull that information together we would get lcls statement as of the end of the year what the income was and what the balance was we would then have to if they had a cd pull that in we would report that up to bankers systems okay and they would then combine that and produce the report it thats why theres normally a cost in those selfdirected because its not with our cds now that information thats the whole account and whatevers out there on the on the retire on the rap record just passes right up and and the cd and the rap information r retirement account processing system talk together mhm when you get another vendor in here like lcl we physically have to put the papers together but its not that complicated but the name of his office is gonna be lcl s its not gonna be first national bank right right anything the the i got a f oh yeah i love expansions of business it took me fortyfive minutes to get a phone number the phone number by the way is for lcl yeah five five five five five five five is what the phone number will be but this is things that im im anxious for matt to get here because im getting im getting tuckered out trying to get all these nittygritty things its not tough to get the phone number but see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead mhm in order to or uh have business cards lcl in in chicago needs that mhm to get that process going hm uh uh is there lcl accounts gonna be maintained here cause cause actually i mean or is there gonna be a separate theyre gonna have an account in chicago for the funds to pass through or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank or is that uh well w what well do is thosell probably wire transfer out through bolt or something well through the fed what i think what will happen but we mattll find this out and i mean well get involved in it and im im not whichever way it goes is fine but probably the most sophisticated way will be everyone who makes who buys a fund or whatever that money will go into a a clearing account here and then we will either lcl will will ach it out of us xx xx or well physically wire it up there you know there may be a hundred thousand dollars in there which may represent three peoples or four peoples purchases mhm and then matt faxes the paperwork up to lcl and they do the suitability testing and then they know what products have been bought and then on the other side we do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there i think thats how its gonna work si similar to fannie mae ex ex uh yes mhm sa same same same type of thing yeah we we we collect monies custod ac we collect monies and put it in account and the we tell them how much of it is theirs and by calling up there xxx and that dial deal and then it they zap it the next day yeah i dont know if okay uh like thats the same way that uh american express with the travelers checks work when we sell travelers checks we put that money in a clearing account and then jo anne or grace or tom or somebody calls whosever doing that job calls a number mhm and we report how much in sales we had and they d they d hit the account the next day and take the money out but thats thats kind of the the mechanics of the of the flow of funds but to answer your question joe is that lcl that office will not say first national bank of hillsdale uh or anything of the nature anywhere yeah uh the his his card will be lcl investments at first national bank of hillsdale u l will be lcl there needs to be a separate phone line going to that office and well well be able when we get this receptionist set up the receptionist will also answer it but when they pick up the phone you know well put it on a red line or blue line or something like that when they pick up that line like we do with with with bills number you know they they pick up and theyll say lcl investments they also and its also requirements by uh uh i guess nasdaq or whomever and the comptroller that they dont want us when that line rings were not gonna pick it up and go hello first national bank of hillsdale and they go oh yeah i wanted to talk about a mutual fund oh im sorry yeah you do have lcl in investments i mean these are some of the nittygritty things yeah they they talk about in the regulation and im pretty confident theyll theyll implement those out but is matt gonna carry on his other livelihood that he had before through that office or is he totally out of the insurance business n he was meeting with they had a regional meeting or meeting with their regional manager today and he was going to to tell him that hes plans to take a job here c common courtesy says that he uh needs to give em two weeks notice but the the practice within the the industry and larry matt said this and also larry harb said this so i know its not matts employer its just within that industry as soon as a person says ive decided to move on to another another uh uh customer xx or an another employer ni come in did you need to talk to genevieve n uh ill g see if shes gonna be at a number where i could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or fortyfive minutes okay or else ill give her a call tomorrow okay um as soon as they get notice they typically say well fine thanks for the two weeks notice but its effective today and then they electronically transfer his licenses to his to to lcl but so these slides should be real interesting yeah i think itll be real interesting i think itll be a real a good slide show too bad you cant make it who else do you know thats been there besides whats her name uh just jessie and shana shana her thats all yeah shanas sort of i wanna go but id like to go al its an interesting thing but hunh id like to go its an interesting thing though because um im wondering you know since it is such um its restricted you have to go through mexico no i dont think so isnt nicara one of the things you no places you cant go i dont think so no i think it i we have no i dont think so we have f f technically speaking full diplomatic re with nicaragua oh yeah yeah they have an an ambassador and you know an american ambassador there i then why does everybody always have to go through mexico who like a nest of cia spies thats just there there isnt a direct transportation but there n i thought its not no but i thought it w its not like going to cuba where they have to make connections through mexico because oh i knew someone who went to cuba and had to go yeah make connections through mexico thats because its il for americans to travel to cuba but i won whether this uh it i yeah it is xxxx oh yeah just like lebanon just became how long they say lebanon is actually how longs they it d just beca illegal and and i you know for a few years how long has it been illegal libya too isnt libya as well theres quite a few pla liby theres only a uh theres only a handful of places how long has it been illegal for americans to go to cuba well since the fif it was il since the fifties it was illegal or the sixties it was illegal you know from like the time of cath the castro revolution up until i think the early seventies the supreme court overturned uh travel restrictions on the um on the passport and said that the government couldnt uh really permit you from going anywh uh prevent you from going anywhere and the tha that changed again a few years later they passed some laws or something like that which d enable the government to to do um visa res restrictions and i think cuba and north korea now leba and now le and libya unhunh are the only places that uh maybe north maybe vietnam also x where you x youre supposedly n able to use your passport to go to but you really i mean you ca they know you know the thing is what im wondering you can like people go to cuba all the time what im wondering is people that go to nicara and less o less often to nicar doesnt the state department to north to vi and north ko wouldnt the state department know everybody that went to nicaragua but people go to cuba all the time p_sure wouldnt they know and tha whats sort of worrisome xxxx is b crawling with the cia thats whats worri worrisome but that im sure if they im sure they have jessie on a list anyway but oh yeah i mean but im saying well hes the only existing live member of the peace and freedom party l you know but but hes a the only one un the age of sixty yeah i know and its really funny that i would think that they would have a a thing on you they would actually possibly even keep an eye on you or or watch you i dont know how many americans have been to nicar oh i doubt it how many no plen therere de therere delegations that a lo have gone thats true a lot of people x a lot of del theres delega going every week thousands yeah thousands have gone x x well there a lot of them are religious so that is you know religious they d theyd usually and there church things and lots of people like trade unions going down to see for themselves and political m you know left leftish unhunh or liberal types a um but uh i would love i would love to go yeah yeah i wanna go too id id ra go to mexico though i not quite the same id kind of like to go to guatemala i wanna go to mexico but i think mexi like the place to go i dont know because its got everything its got history its got big cities yeah its got ruins and its got and its got re you know and oh go god listen to you the the caribbean is incre re its just this bl beau beau blue water wha i know i know the caribbean is incredible beau beautiful beautiful blue blue water and and warm water and like coral and tropical f and incredible r like resort like u hotels and restaurants oh when we were there last we th it was just after an election and i got all these great u photographs of of like um posters and demos election posters you know from all the like little uh hunger strikes the little various leftish parties and theyd like you know p post then um uh wall graffiti and and posters all over everything so i took a bunch of pictures of that and they were pr currently having u hunger strikes all over southern mexico b u because it was a particularly i mean it was even it was real o corrupt election much it was even m c it was even more corrupt than the usual corrupt election what they did is they stuffed ballots and oh yeah uh they they always stuff ballots but this f ti uh was real obvious it was even m blatant than usual and uh so i got all i got pictures of them having their um their uh people the people doing hunger strikes and that kind of thing ill put a spell on you and in um in particular in one little indian town f forgot what the town was called tlacochahuaya you know i mean most of these things we saw like in in oaxaca an you know places that were that were um pretty big but we went to this one little tiny indian town and u uh there they you know in the in the little u i forget what they call it the central the little central plaza area la plaza mercado what w y uh i forget there was some term they used for it oh yeah so the the zocalo zocalo the zocalo the zocalo zocalo un u there was a big b what is this a big band there theres a tow and there is a town right around here that is still has a zocalo thats built around a zocalo you were telling me a that oh that was right th well uh that was sonoma sonoma still has a zocalo did you know that it really does yeah it was built around a its its built during the the mexican the whole tow is still built around the vil uh the plaza actually probably during the spanish period and or during the mexican period i dont know and but the whole town still has the old mexican plaza and the mexican governor generals house was right there and a the church and thats like the main street and that kind of thing is uh you know uh you know right in the center of sonoma sonoma of all places yeah so you can go up there and p_see old california and drink wine thats interesting s um did you ever find out what disease you had no i went to the doctor and he uh did a blood test i think you ought to change doc and said and said uh i just went to some local doctor right here i didnt go to deutsch oh you didnt go to him u no he just di did a blood test and said yeah well your b your bloods all shot and you have the liver of a ninetyyearold u do you dri and il and i and i think and he doesnt drink and i think i think uh you you picked up some v u virus virus like uh he named like half a dozen viruses and said ah i could do some more tests and find out which one but by the time we got the test results back youd probably be over with it anyway so why bother he is like that though thats his attitude that wasnt deutsch thats what i dont like about him oh that wasnt deutsch that sou like deutsch no that sounds like something he would do no it was somebody right here

romantically involved uh i guess so theyve been doing it for a while now its really ama x i think though its really neat to watch em he he ca he he like t uh tw takes his nails there he goes again and he flutters em in front of it like trying to cast a spell over her yeah its really ama have you read why thats done xx yeah hes trying to cast a spell over her oh and thats in the turtle book xx is he really well no i mean its not literally that uh thats their like hypnotize her thats their um thats the little mating its their mating courtship ritual dance and when and when shes kinda when shes interest he saw them porking you know i saw em i saw em actually doing it im one of the very few living human beings whove seen turtles having sex you know look there he goes again hes trying uh she doesnt see hes wiggling the things in front of her face halalalalalala trying to get her interested hes got these real real long finger yeah the males only have the nails the real long the ma uh and fat tails the males have those l look watch watch watch him flutter and i love the little fl have you seen it flutter its rea ama and yet shes not running from him i remember at the beginning when he started his courtship thing she was f running around like trying to get away from him and he was biting her yeah and stuff like that now uh i dont really know i mean i havent i havent s bothered to sit around and catalog what theyre doing you know but this i think is fairly l i think this is hes just crying to like could be foreplay check her out this is this is hes checking her out i dont even think its gotten to the foreplay yet yes it could be this is the hey comeere babe you know and shes kinda uh k shining him on shes not r but shes not showing a lot of interest either i think when he starts biting her his tail is curved like that does it al get curved like that yeah yeah you know i dont know and some its straight yeah i think when he starts biting her thats when hes do you know hes a lot more interested and so is she that when we bought him when we bought him he was larger than her now look at them shes a glutton h was larger than her uh remember that shes like twice as big as he is now i mean i i just cant imagine its incredible shes just growing shes gonna be as big as that turtle in the pet shop yeah in thirty years how big is that hu i mean it is just theyve had this thing uh th this turtle for like thirty years like twenty years ever since the pet shore opened up the problem is is its in a tank this size and thats kinda sad yeah it does it cant move it cant swim it cant do anything what are you gonna do when it gets this big youre gonna have to like transfer it to a bathtub youre gonna have to have a mm like an old old bathtubs arent hard arent hard to find ah p i give her a qu swift kick into the la river at that point oh come now ke n ken you would not you kidding me how could you abandon her about twenty y she alr she already eats me out of house and ho yes she doe oh x but you know a few wor when she gets that big oh a few worms when she gets that big shell need a v of worms and theyre ex well uh youll pro them youll have all your in you know what and shell be supporting you you know no yeah im gonna b what am i gonna what is it that im gonna be invested you know what though ken you said as they get older they z they eat more vegetable matter yeah so ill have to b feed her and grapes ill have to feed her h of lettuce will the pro needs go down at a time or i gue no you know what hes thats what ive read hes such a softie he you know what they do eat that he refuses which would be easy to feed cheap im not gonna give them gold l they love to eat they love they on eat live food sadistic im not gonna k_give them x its against his his his philoso of life id love to see it xxx id love to see him chase and eat up a goldfish yeah a roman circus in your tank and they wont let me see it im not xxx it just i mean the idea of dropping a little g into there and then like you know watching it like go like its nea you know like pick g off the bottom and do its little goldfish business you know and then all of a sudden have a turtle come over and take a big hunk out of it you know and then that gets a little sh x they wont eat it the thing is it you know the thing it uh will actually be ha swimming and half not uh oh and they take bites out of it well xx you know they take bi they d its not a who thing you know and and sometimes they can get the whole thing down at once other times they just like eat the tail they dont quite make it and a piece of the fin and and then the you know the goldfish manages to get away and flutters around the tank trying to get away from him oh ha half go oh ken i dont have the heart for that kind of thing when you say it that way i dont think i could stand it eith well you know what i was doing is for about two months when i had that snake in my classroom i would once a week it would be a whole ritual tuesday the kids knew tuesday we would all sit around the rug wed put the snake we we named it sissy and wed put wed s put sissy like right in front of all the kids and i would get buy a feeder locally and i would bring it in and i would put it in the little thing and we would watch the snake hunt you know we would watch sissy hunt the goldfish and the go and the snake and it was so h your snake was eating goldfish yeah mhm it would l eat only li things th thats the only way they feed you have to buy em feeder fish yeah they wont eat uh some k some k of sn wont eat theyll eat crickets uh eat dead things and things like that oh yeah so you put little gold down in the box i would put it and then it would b theyd put it in a little no no in a bow in like a little cup a little water and cause itll only eat it live and so the snake the bowl was about yea big you know and then the snake would start to it would see it and it would start to do this who little dance it would start circling the bowl and wrapping itself and it would get faster and faster then it would start s it would start moving at the same pace that the snake would b that the fish would be swimming and it would start kinda following it and going fast and fast it would be like this little whirlwind you know and all of a sudden it would go chk and you know whats so funny the snake was v th theyre v theyre very b th i guess theyre very bright about goldfish cause it it would ra get it it would rarely get the fish it w by the fin it would almost always get it by the head because it was streamlined cause it would it it would get it by the tail then the fins would all get it would be hard to swallow do you know what i mean mhm it would get all fluffed out right and um the kids loved it well it was their f time of the week they lo and excep b little bastards i had one little girl i had one little girl named ana me and she was this sensitive sweet little girl from uh guatemala who was actually her language was great and every time you know what she would do the first time she did she she did she crossed herself she did the cross for the fish for the fish and i asked her why did you do that little fishy and she goes so that the fishll go to heaven aw was that sweet and then from that point and then she cried and then from that point on everybody would be sitting there looking at the fish anxiously and i would have to tell em to sit down cause you know uh others cant see calm down calm down she would turn around so shed be facing the wall so she couldnt watch well a very sensitive little kid this sevenyear kid and she wouldnt wa and she was it was like talk about you know i not influenced by peer pressure cause all the kids were excited and and she knew in a sense that she was s kinda supposed to be excited cause all of the other kids and she no she was and its really really really interesting you know i won what her personal history x xx and and then we yeah oh you know we drew i know what was so funny is you know we had like language les from it uh we wrote about it you know and they would do one or two sentences about it and a lot of the kids mentioned ana and y the snake sissy s uh ate the fish and ana cried that was like their a lot of them did those sen great and it was really fu and then a lot of them would draw a picture of ana you know theyd theyd do their sentences and then theyd draw a picture of ana um crying and what did she write u sissy ate the fish and i cried uh i uh ki i dont remember what she wrote but it was something similar like that it was something like the f the ate the goldfish and stuff and i wouldnt you know id i would have it from the morning cause i would pick it up in the morning or id pick it up the n thats what id do id pick it up the night before like if it w if were feeding it i would pick it up monday i would take it home and that was the worst part i would take it home and i would like put it in i would leave it in its plastic bag put it in a bunch of water in the sink and i wouldnt go near the sink cause i didnt wanna look at this thing i didnt wanna get friendly with this fish you know and then i would take it in i would t put it in its bag and i would put it in a paper bag and so i wouldnt look at it and i would put it like over by the sink in the classroom all day you know until it was feeding time and i wouldnt look at it and i wouldnt let the kids look at it only when it was put into the bowl cause i just it was i was the worst you didnt wanna get i was going ew ew you know like th listen to her it was really f you know five minutes ago she said she really would love to see the turtles eat a goldfish uh now shes saying how it was the wor no no no but xxx it was just the i of it its interesting its neat yeah its interesting but you know to see it but but but to ac see it is is no as uh i remember once when i was a kid it r_its really stuck in my mi uh uh i went i used to l u go to an elementary school that had like a p a pet shop right around the corner from it and i used to go into the pet stores and look at all the b the ani didnt you guys go to the same elemen school and the fish and stuff all the time los feliz anyway um uh where was y el where was the pet right around the corner where th_you know where the bank is the security bank and theres all those little shops unhunh theres like tamara that sandwich shop and stuff on hollywood u hunh no on verm on hol it was on ver on vermont like w maybe six shops up from from uh u hollywood or prospect rather u there was a little pet shop called pandoras pets when i was in elementary school pandors pets anyway i remember they had a they had this fish in there called an oscar and they are these like they are these really i remember yeah th theyre big theyre these big gnarly suckers theyre like um yeah i remember what they look like theyre like m f i dont know six or eight inch big eyes and theyve got they only eat like other fish they eat like small fish and they eat like you know like goldfish and i guess goldfish or g get the brunt of everything poor guys theyre like the you know theyre like the cattle of the animal world theyre br only to f other things yeah f yeah theyre feeders anyway anyway so theyre nothing but tanks of feeders in every pet shop i remember w watching them feed the oscar once when i was a kid and they dropped in the goldfish and i dont think id ever seen it before maybe i did i dont remember but this time particularly sticks in my mind he drops the goldfish into the tank and the goldfish goes and sw swims around minding his own little business eating glop and all that shit you know that fish do and the oscar sneaks up behind it and opens its mouth and like creates a v kinda thing cause oh my go you got this huge mouth that s the gold in oh my god right from the water yeah and and then and it doesnt even xx and then uh but the goldfish got s halfway into his mou it went the wrong way no it was going fin first it was going mouth first well it was going it went tail first thats the problem i guess thats the wrong way thats the problem i dont know anyway so you got this oscar there swimming around in the tank i learned a lot from that snake with like a goldfish sticking out of his mouth you know the the head of a goldfish so you could see the little goldfishs eyes and his little m going g_bloop bloop bloop bloop and the oscars there swimming around and you could tell the little goldfish i mean they dont have what you would call massively expressive faces but i think it was worried you know it g its going bloop bloop bloop bloop and its got these like wideopen eyes you know i was just imagining what was going through its little m as the oscar was swimming around frantically trying to dislodge it so it could swallow it you know and u finally it d did manage to you know v like loosen it spit it out uh i dont know remember if it spat it out or cack it up or what but it managed to like uh you know dis it m dis it one way and then swallow it well u i wanted to say im really happy with the stuff i got now good good and im really basically im back for a tape deck oh ok so u one of my thoughts is that u well i want a tape deck thats gonna sound about you know as good as it ca okay and i think i want a tape deck with two places for two tapes so i can copy okay but ive never done this before i dont know much about tapes i mean i h okay i have a b you know ordinary sort of thing sure so i wonder if you would suggest that this luxman is the is w one of the things youd wanted me to think about uh u the uh would you you would want the the ability uh of the double cassette deck just purely for taping from one tape to the other thats its main purpose in fact i wouldnt know what other purpose it uh_would ha oh okay the other benefit is is if you can load up two tapes in it like lets say two ninety minute tapes of music unhunh i see and you can set a switch on it i see where it will continually play okay okay all four sides of two tapes i see thats probably not gonna hap okay no its mainly for copying okay so and the tapes youd be copyi uh are they gonna be straight music m okay yeah okay yeah so you are gonna want or desire a pretty d uh copy of your original tape mhm right okay u and the originals will be from music lovers you know who probably have pretty good systems not okay im were not talking stratosphere sure but sure anyway okay u because on a u a tape deck like that you realize that youre not gonna be able to get a copy thats you know mhm as perfect as mhm the original sour was mhm or even as that tape was mhm there is gonna be some loss mhm in the generation of making that copy mhm and is there a way to avoid that loss i mean how x well youre youre gonna have that loss j because of all the different things involved right f from taking it from one tape and putting it on the other tape right right theres a lot of things in the signal path there right so youre youre b to lose something yeah its not huge no matter what you know it may be ten perc okay or five perce right or something like that right right uh which is a small amount and youll st still be able to enjoy the the music and the message its trying to bring across mhm mhm mhm okay s okay i dont see a problem in that u the other thing i realize is uh think about how much of the time youre gonna be doing that mhm because of you are paying a decent premium to have that conve mhm mhm mhm so what kind of price difference are we talking about suppose i just get one tape oh okay and l my friends copy tapes for me and okay yeah u right like lets say there would be about u couple different steps okay okay one would be a s cass deck u tha wou uh play the tape you know and after side as done then you have to take the tape out and flip it over and play side b okay okay okay right that would be your first level right and luxman has a gr cassette deck to fill th needs o and u all of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty so the qualitys mhm you know put into them uh mhm they really put a lot into them to be able to give that kind of warranty m and u theyre pretty conservative in their uh specifications where what they say their cassette decks will do they will y usually out perform that okay a w the unit you already have the receiver that has the full remote control right all the units uh youre looking at here will uh go along with tha mhm and u as far as the remote control funtions go right where the remote control will control the decks right right okay the decks come with whats called a din cable and that plugs in the unit you have now mhm right okay this is the kay one eleven okay this would be i guess youd say the entry level right to integrate into your system okay u this gives you a lot of pluses that most peoples basic decks dont have hm okay it has dolby mhm which as you know thats a circuit to cut the tap hiss without cutting the high frequencies right right and u uh r dolby is dolby b thats like u mhm when you buy tapes at the wherehouse theyre in dolby right u in addition to that it gives you dolby c mhm when youre making your own tapes at ho like lets say from the cd hm mhm making a tape to play back on this tape deck mhm youre gonna wanna record it in dolby c mhm thats gonna sound sonically super mhm u or if f are recording tapes in dolby c then youll be able to play it back and itll sound right hm okay okay so if somethings recorded in dolby b you wanna play it in dolby b dolby c you wanna play it in dolby c you dont want to mhm mix and match uh okay the it doesnt sound quite right nkay so this gives you that hunh it also gives you whats called hx pro okay mhm wh is a feature usually only found in r uh r expensive cassette decks mm hm and that i is an improvement in the recording section of it hm and it allows you to record a little bit mhm u higher record level so you hear less tape hiss mhm m and also has a little bit more u high frequency response hm mhm okay so this one here youre looking at three hundred eighty dollars mhm hm m o a u from there the next step for what youre looking at would be the kay one ten okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the on the kay one eleven mhm u with the addition of the convenience feature of having auto reverse yeah and thats ni just like in the car x where yeah it will play uh side b after side a is finished automatically yeah where you dont have to get up and flip the tape o the other thing about it is you can flip the tape over at any point in the middle mhm right uh a the other thing y lets say if youre entertaining you can put in a ninety minute tape mhm put it on continuous auto reverse m mhm have a re of your favorite songs right m for a party right a dinner party whatever right and play side a then side b then side a side b yeah thats good itll just go forever thats good okay okay u right so thats what it gives you in the kay one ten mhm now the d or double cassette deck that luxman offers is basically a u double version o the kay one ten ri and they call it the kay one ten doubleu okay uh and s whats the price diffe here oh okay im sorry the yeah the kay one ten is four hundred eighty dollars alright and the kay one ten doubleu is five hundred eighty dollars mhm okay okay so you paid a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse then youre paying another hundred dollars to have yeah right double cassette deck thats auto reverse okay mhm okay um the convenience on this is obvious mhm whe u they even have u you know buttons set up for mhm dubbing or copy mhm from one tape deck to the other mhm u so its really set up to be just cranking out hm uh copies m now the other thing is it has a feature where it will do it in half the time hm or high speed dubbing hm hm hm hm which is s nice so it doesnt take the whole period of ti right to make your copy mhm and it will continue making the copy you know from side a then and itll flip over right and to side b u so we weve talked about it how uh how it has the dubbing speed select buttons mhm so you can make a a high speed copy mhm u the other thing that sets this apart from a lot of other dual de is it has a separate dolby button for each cassette deck mhm ge uh gesundheit thank you yeah u where a lot of units will hm just have a dolby setting mhm and thats the same for both decks i see i see but there may be a situation where a friend of yours yeah mhm whos a real audiophile made uh mhm a real premium tape for you mhm recorded in dolby c mhm well you wanna record it in dolby b so you can play it back in your walkman mhm and in your automobi cassette player mhm mhm uh in that scenario youre gonna want to play it back in dolby c but recor it in dolby b yeah okay o thats good so this gives you that convenience nkay now the other thing is lets say u that friend of yours came over for dinner with his p tape mhm and you had your prize tape mhm of of some else you could load them both up mhm mhm put it on continuous u unhunh auto reverse and it will play side a side b of one tape go over to the other tape right and play mhm side a then side b and it con go forever right o u hunh which is kinda nice wow now the other thing you can do with this deck i yeah in your system you can make a copy from tape to tape while youre listening to something else n unhunh so you could be listening to your cd right while youre making a tape copy right thats right o um the other thing you can do is um as i recall one can listen to the tuner so you could put on kdb mhm or i i right uh or theres one matt likes i forget what its called but anyhow right um or he wants to get kfac i think it is yeah which is kind of tough um so you could be listening to the radio while taping a cd mhm you you know right it allows you to do that right right okay which you have to pay attention to what youre doing okay i know thats right yeah yeah but at least you have that flexibili okay and so it sounds like f what youve told me uh uh you know about youre desire to make good quality copies of tapes mhm mhm this is gonna be the tape deck mhm that would fit your needs mhm and integrate well with your system a right allow the remote to fully control it okay well what youve said helps me a lot i actually may i mean i d do this so often and it may well be that i id do better just going back to one of these others mhm um in the oth in fact im the oth the other thing i was gonna say is is it do you have um if you had some other type of quality cassette deck mhm even if it was a unf mhm one in the office or uh mhm yeah a port or something like that mhm i could somehow hook it up into your system mhm so you could tape from i right right to one of these right okay thats possible and the the prices i gave you were the uh luxman suggested prices right since youve bought couple pieces here m and also been through the fire im sure we can work something else out for you mhm i dont know okay how well uh uh lets see here um the kay one eleven which is the the basic one right but uh i dont when i say basic i mean basic in their line right its still very good yeah uh youd be looking at three hundred fortynine dollars nkay the uh lets see here the kay one ten mhm uh we could do four hundred and fortyfive right and the kay one ten doubleu uh we could do five thirty nine mhm okay well that looks great and i th i belie theres one that we didnt talk about and thats the kay one twelve m okay and the kay one twe is basically the audiophiles dream cassette deck o mhm its a its a single cassette and its single direction m where it doesnt flip over by itself right what sets it apart is it has three discrete heads hunh okay and this will make a superior tape copy hm um or a superior tape period u hm because it has three heads hm and what it does is that it has a separate head for record a separate head for play hm where most decks have a combination record play head un an uh um this also has some adjustments on it uh such as b fine trim hm uh which allows you to tailor the cassette decks electronics to the specific tape youre using m so obviously you can see theres uh right a b a bit more invol with it yeah yeah for the purist this is the way to go here youre looking at six hundred dollars okay okay right okay well this is very helpful let me ask you one other thing x suppose that i wanna use this tape deck to record um conversation like we do in in linguistics between matt and me or something like that okay then how does it work lets say go back to the kay one ten uh or the one theres one deck here i think thats s up for that or the one el el lets take a look here the kay one ten mhm has provisions for microphones on the front un and its one of the few cassette decks okay made for the consumer hi fi market today that do have that o a so you can plug in one microphone yeah uh where it has a position uh thats mono mh and it will record it on both tracks of it mhm uh mhm and then if you want hm you can plug in two mics and it senses when you plug in the second mic hm okay and so itll record in ster okay and then it has a record level on it hm so you can adjust the record le mhm depend on how loud youre talking mhm an then also the type of tape youre using m and the level you want on the tape hm hm uh so the kay one ten w be set up for that hunh any of the other um cassette decks here m the kay one eleven has it too i take hunh i i take it back huh i didnt think the kay ele lev one eleven did unhunh unhunh o its the its the dual one that doesnt okay the dual one does not have those provisions now that doesnt mean that it cannot be done right what has to happen then is uh one hooks up a mhm a separate outboard piece called a microphone amp okay okay and so what happens is your mic runs into i mhm and then it plugs into your receiver mhm into one of its inputs okay and so one of your inputs on your receiver lets say tape two paul mhm would ac be a micro run run mhm yeah and so you would hit that y mhm and that would um paul saved my ass go o mhm um nkay into your tape deck if you wanted to record a tape right right okay so um m so the kay one ten which is the single auto reverse yeah has the mic provisions right the kay one eleven has the mic provisions and sos the kay one okay great o the b the benefit of the one ten the big benefit is the auto re right u im one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse oh yeah i dont know why the first time i mean this is the first time ive had it on my b and for some reason maybe i just have to learn when i put the tape in i never know which direction its gonna go so i have a hard time finding wh you want making it play what i want it to play okay the way it usually works i um the side of the tape thats out or facing you that label side mhm mhm corresponds with the arrow that will point to the right theres usually two little arrows that will light up nkay yeah telling you which direction its pla right right okay the arrow that points to the right i see i the label s of the tape thats facing you o that you can see okay okay thats the way it usually works okay now the other thing that throws people off i fast forward and rewind mhm will v depending on which side of the tape youre on right right right okay thats what throws people off yeah all the time yeah i just um ill ill work on getting used to that but i just might go with the single you know the one that i have to turn it over oh i mean uh you know thats fine you know thats fine um im trying i mean i had a couple recently uh bodeckers uh got the kay one eleven and and they love it yeah they dont play tapes that much yeah thats the same with me too yeah im really in cds now unhunh yeah so but they have a couple of these box sets of uh right symphonie right and then i think they even have a couple books on tape yeah and for that its p right you know its probably w more than enough right right u im just trying to look and see what other differences there are okay i i mean i really think those are the thats the big difference this is no this is great um doo doo i believe yeah i think thats the basic difference is that auto reverse let me ask you do you sell microphones here uh we dont really nya nya nya nya nya nya kay get into them nkay um we are nya nya nya nya nya nya u you ca ge me connected with a distributor that does deal with them okay and so we weve gotten them for clients time to ti try to ge me okay um i think we have them available from sony a id really have to l r that a bit for you thats okay i i can follow through on that you have any idea how much a good okay sort of um table mic would co um well u you can get one f uh ah s i would say i would expect to pay maybe f f forty dollar and up okay i mean really the skys the limit with microphones right right i mean you can get okay n thousand dollar microphone okay but um you would proba i would spend you know i wouldnt spend nineteen dollar mhm m id spend forty bu yeah yeah okay and then maybe a little up above that nkay mhm for what you wanna do i i d ever see paying you know a couple hundred dollars mhm that that would probably be right f very overkill okay so that kind of gives you an idea mhm right okay u theres a place to look um called sound advice yeah al okay theres a guy there named wayne yeah okay hes uh thats a good idea one of the principals there wayne okay i think his name is shaybeck alright saybeck shaybeck something like that and hes a really knowledgeable guy okay hes been in the business for a long time great uh and theyre good guys there okay so that would be a a place to look at a mic okay thatd be great yeah um if we n to d get a price on a tape r recor that we lost see what we lost was a tape recorder not a tape deck okay it was a fancy uher that name rings a bell are y oh really it was yeah oh gosh right th thats like but considered i mean theres a lot of different m of uhers mhm bu uh theyve always been considered probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders mhm mhm yeah right uh w our blue book usually shows the u yeah our older uhers okay so i could show you what the blue book price was then if i nkay its gonna be hard to d okay i dont know uhers that well its gonna be hard to determine mhm what would be a comparable replacement to i know right yeah and that would be something you may wanna run by wayne okay great nkay you dont sell that kind of thing here right cause this is an audio thats right place well i mean okay to tell you the truth th sometimes we do get them for people mhm okay through the distribu we deal with yeah but uh yeah okay overall well usually we dont this is great yeah what i think ill do is um take these ideas back to matt okay and ill be back sleep on it then yeah yeah yeah i need to think about what you told me uh but this is very helpful for me okay i really appreciate it just for your know u the kay one ten and the kay d one ten doubleu mhm thats the auto rev single auto rev right and double auto reverse we have in stock okay the kay one eleven hm um i dont believe i have in sto but were gonna be placing a luxman order soon and since they ship out of torrance mhm um you know lead time isnt too bad on it but just know that mhm you couldnt call me up and then listen to a tape that night right okay thats fine o o um but were talking like maybe a week or some oh yeah okay yeah no problem if that i mean listen if that im not that uh okay th the timing isnt that tight ive waited a long ti okay for a lot of stuff so no okay its not a big problem but i appreciate your letting me know about that okay okay um okay pete had told me matt came by and picked up some literature on i th guess the l l s the little speakers y we were talking a right i dont i dont okay i dont know if he actually got the exact one i recommended or not yeah and then uh there was an article on uh fm antennas i had recommended to him mhm and pete made a copy of it for him yeah okay okay thats great yeah that was really helpful so do you had you heard anything ha has he read that and hes thinking right thinking yeah okay good that was part of what we had to that was part of what we had to put in the specs we needed to know the size and this whole antenna question whether you could put an antenna you talked about this with him okay un under the roof and everyth yes cause you know you cant have that stuff showing thats right thats right not where we are yeah yeah uh okay hows the house moving along coming alo were gonna be putting the uh specs out for bids great with the month so great yeah thats progress so thats isnt it its progress yeah were going as fast as we can were gonna have like four weeks we just have to wait while the bidding exactly a um but x well then if then if you sit up at night thinking then should we go for him i know it or should we go for him its just what i was telling jeff i said we got all these places in the specs where were were having to say you know k figure this one separately cause we may have to axe it you know and were just biting our nails cause we dont know what th the bot line is gonna be sure th yeah so maybe uh anyway some parts of it will really surprise you yeah and some parts will be a lot less than you thought yeah like windows arent as expensive as i thought so its oh thats how its going well thats good yeah well you have to do double glazed up there now yeah thats true right yeah um which some t which adds a bit yeah to the cost goes up well well keep you post on okay how its all going just let me know and ill certainly l you know about this thing um ill be calling you back o within a few days and i i think i had given you some literature before yeah on that and it shows those cassette decks in there okay if you need an addi piece thats right i can i i can get you one uh n youre i think youre right okay yeah thats what i had looked at so i think is w no you dont have the i have the d the one the double one here right right and i have the thats what i saw the real high end um mhm single one yeah okay al the other t the other the single auto reverse i have in stock i just dont have on dis yeah thats alright yeah okay okay good thanks so much well that gives you an idea alright good okay good i kept you five minutes but i bet oh i bet its been worse than that before its its oh this is no yeah this is nothing this is a joy hunh to tell you the truth good good well i think youve got another sale okay so okay well just have to talk to matt thank you yeah hm yeah and even if i go out and a for it you know i say can i copy that i wont feel guilty i really wont its just a set of instructions i used to program a little bit and a u those guys have so much fun writing those programs you know thats the i think thats thats pretty yeah well uh thats pretty much the end of it creative people generally do what they love to do yeah right and thats pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process the rest of it is all m hm and the marketplace is uh you know maybe i think i live in tangiers you know maybe i think the marketplace is uh you get what you can get yeah uh seems to be that way you know i as long as im not hurting another person directly right you know or even indirectly but just throwing my money out there he may never see a penny of it he may have sold the rights outright you know that certainly happens in music happens ye i yeah yeah you know i mean it happens all over the place you know i wish i was uh the person whose voice they used in the telephone when it tells you the number has been changed and that i had uh copyright get some royalties like that lady you know h you hear the number you have reached daduh daduh daduh daduh daduh daduh they got a different woman didnt they hunh didnt they get a different woman when she th tried to do that i dont know if they did they they they hired an voice i didnt hear any followup but thats what i thought that they did any yeah hunh they certainly u her a lot but i mean it they only use what a s uh five seconds total or something you know its a probably took her a lo time to to say every possible combination oh but they the computer does that all she has to do is say each digit and the computer oh thats all it is yeah its like a series of samples and it automatically sorts em unhunh yeah right yeah so its probably the total actual s speaking that they use is pretty short it would be much more pleasant if they had done all the combinations though you know call it up and theres something that actually says your number in toto you know yeah or because it recognizes your phone number it automatically goes into the computer finds that yeah and a and names the na that sample thank you mister smith for calling pacific bell yeah right you know i am your personal computer representative thatd be great push one if you wish to know my phone number push two if you wish to h my phone number that i you know have dinner with me push three if you want to uh uh artif intelligence personality that you call up yeah so if you do not like this personality push zero and a new personal yeah will be pro for you yeah at no extra charge yeah hunh you are allowed up to five personalities in one phone call uh well the networking of computers is getting uh s that you know almost anythings possible any xx yeah thats why i like it its just matrix and just con constantly building and building u building upon building on these complexities and build controllers for the thats right and and building on top of those and youre building on the thoughts of th your predecessors but your predecessors in this case could be like last year you know its like its moving so fast oh so fast its like a r its a reflection of the brain and its communication like books but its much quicker and its like but when they get if you can think of something and define it you can make it happen if it just about information i mean you cant if its just about information thats very true yeah you cant conjure something up like a car out of nothing but well with the superconductors uh thats gonna make it you know s economical mhm for everybody to have all the electronic this and that that they want because therell be so little loss of electricity yeah and itll be small you know and it itll be f so small that well have enormous amount uh we should have an enormous supply of it yeah like every light switch will have its own computer or something you know basically because itll be cheap enough that cheap as a switch these days or something it wont cost anything you know ky and it and when they go into outer space and start growing this thi those uh silicon chips without any flaw hm theyll be able to uh grow circuitry that is so complicated that you know that gravity destroy it so theyll be able to uh hm uh yeah uh to i theyll be able to get these fanta uh c f like say for a whole television set just on one chip a uh uh and then itll harden out there and k theyll bring it back a uh the whole thing is s is s is so sensational thatll be expensive at first god but can you growing em in space but thats great yeah itll itll uh itll be worth it in this technology out of m of uh m anything in the pa ha has m its becoming like were shaping our our destiny or ourselves u with this technology more than we have in uh with any other in the past it seems just b_like whatever we think it b uh we can make it but theres one technology thats u gonna overtake that and thats d research which is like a total scam at this point still its theyre just like bombarding uh organisms with radiation to see what comes up you know we have very little control over it but once we do well be able to progra biology as well well tha pretty frightening con it is frightening but we cant even control our freeways um i know you know i mean but i uh the thing is any s technology that comes up it gets used once its out there in the open the well i hope the so as a a whole i hope they use fractals are you familiar with fractals unhunh yeah i hope they use a lot of fractals be f in biolo re uh uh no but in well the connection between mathematics and biology can be found k unhunh uh m easily with fractals than it can with uh regular mathematics yeah yeah so you know im looking for the p connection between science and a religion and and and and bio mhm as it were ar th you know the living as spiritual and the and the like the ancient science were and the sci and the scienti pardon it was like the ancient science it was just a branch of knowledge which is included all knowledge basi alchemy alchemy right unhunh yeah whatever gets the job done the the the ge the totality i taken into account as opposed to as opposed to the observer right you know i remember m back in the psychedelic days there was this poster of the scientist ive always been on a kind of a crusade uh for scientific uh responsibility right and scientists are are taking such control over the world these days uh with their n you know not the scientists but what theyve invented and the way its marketed and the way were d we develop needs for it and i remember this pf cartoon i saw w of of it was called the scientist and it had this this wonderful stone statue about twenty stories tall of a naked ma and a naked woman intertwined with each other hugging each other full frontal and their arms wrapped around each other and then they s they they looked like they were so intertwined and they spiraled down and and theyre a s theyre a statue right hm made out of sto and theyre and the whole b of the statue is crumbling right and its just like rubble f like from just below the knee down was just kind of rubble but the rest of it was all real clear a few little some of it was chipped off you know it was ol but and d and down at the bo of this this rubble was this little m who was a scientist and he had this big magnifying glass and he was looking at the rubble looking with his head down hm not looking up at the statue and seei the lo and the the the symbol there but looking down at the crumbs you know hm at the rubble at the bottom with his magnifying glass an an to me that that always symbolized kind of rather clearly the limitations of the scientific method whi if it doesnt take into account well the to the the the whole human experience and including the unbelievable parts of it the parts that are just legend and myth and a uh alluded to you mean the theories and and the psychedelic experiences and the subjec oh on that side you know and insanity and what i mean well you know they uh theyve got to take ac into account uh uh but you cant the east with all its with all its fantas discoveries but you cant look at the stars with a microscope and science is a microscope each p_scientist has their their field of um experti and if theyre gonna go if theyre gonna stretch out far enough into the the unknown where they can find something new they have to do it in a straight line they cant do it thats true in all directions at once because then you run into things that we already know so the problem is communication between s but theyre doing it theyre doing it with mathematics right i mean well n no but the comm problem is communication between the branches of science mhm i think thats true cause whos gonna be able to hold all that knowledge and make the connections well the philosopher and the spiritual leaders an i mean cause f the stuff can be understand understood the goa those people can tell you or the or the cutting cutting edge can be understand understood intellectually but those people cant tell you the details they know the whole structure but see well the its like both sides you have to have somebody looking at the details y got to have a leader and somebody looking at the and you got to have a bunch of workers you know yeah a you gotta have somebody right who d_isnt necessarily inclined to deal with the details that mu whos guiding those who are willing to sit there i guess thats the problem and make all the we dont have a guider yeah theres no l theres no lead or theres no focus yeah and thats right a uh you know i think i think that one of the reasons that theres been no focus is because uh uh everybody accepted the scientific method as the best too that we ha and was kinda letting the scientific method be the mhm be the leader the the w you know just continue inventorying and well those people who are doing re continue inventorying cataloging uh_experimenting you know documenting uh uh whatever and instead of instead of uh uh coming at it from another direction trying to find trying to find uh trying to find way to to like with with einstein for example you know uh it seemed to me he was trying to f t_he was ex per experimenting with with new ways of doing things you know well thinking about things uh uh and thinking about things and he was trying to he w i think he was ultimately trying to trying to discover the speed of his own thought hm you know i mean uh he was like really off into wonderful abstract notions that were all based in a peaceful world you know that couldnt exist unless he was secure that we had a peaceful world or that that peace was part of it of what he was abou and so much of todays technology is soulless and has nothing to do with peace it has to do with just generally chewing up you know consumerism basical and mhm chewing up ch n j chewing up new w uh chewing up the human experience and turning it into some kind of consumer need did you ever get into tesla uh just uh ever so peripherally he had a lot of real wacky ideas on big levels he wanted a world power system that you could um tap into the air basically and get power anywhere on earth and um y thats what the tesla coil was about yeah but e the problem was that it it uh it interfered with um well matter i mean y it was n a clean broadcast system like everything in the room if you had a tesla coil in the middle of the room all the metal objects would be receiving it constant m so it wasnt really a very efficient either because youd have to have a an immense amount of power being broadcast so that a few points could receive you know their share of it now what about if they i with the superconductor will that change all that i dont know he was dealing with it being basically energy and being sent through the air uh you know like light like yeah like tapping right into just the energy of the earth or something alright yeah which doesnt really uh require a conductor yeah may you know i mean light will go through a vacuum so uh i think he was i mean he va basically invented the radio and stuff like that you know its pretty confusing to me but uh yeah those those guys are the guys i think that are the heroes uh or that are the unsung heroes yeah you know the r the uh and s and and business and i mean this is a cliche but but business has always uh taken these works and and manipulated em either to their benefit or to our benefit or to our detriment or something f based on economic wh what the obvious or the hm more immediate econo right its like well gee yeah i know i know how we can make money with this i mean you just do it yeah well thats what i like about fractals is because uh uh with these new mathematical formulas mhm even though you know because its mathematical and it i it has to work i guess with numbers in it somew some way uh its opens a door into what appears to be all the substance thats underneath the obvious you know hm with if if regular math is the obvious uh these fractals seem to seem to represent everything that numbers arent a uh thats well something that numbers arent i dont think its everything not everything but s cause there are t but the first window into that yeah well it like every theory is just like uh uh_its a window and its also like a model of um reality and its really not reality and uh like a fractal can g really close at do uh like describing growth patterns like a plant or something yes yes right right um but its still n not the totality of a plant no it isnt by any stretch but for mathematics or for science its the its an opportunity for them to its the cl th we have to yeah to get closer to to the ch or the or the order of chaos mhm uh that exists uh uh a uh as subtext to our life to our experience on this planet and when were mm and when were say when were going to uh say blow up the first atomic bomb and and and we dont bother to ask the american people or the people of the world if w if if we mi uh if theres a chance you know cause they didnt know for sure whether it would de the universe or not yeah or not and it might have started a chain reaction that just blew up the whole earth thats right and it might very well still have started that chain reaction and that its all happening in fractal country and it has aah and it and its manifesting itself in in disharmony uh in in the deterioration of the planet were all worried about the ozone were all worried about the uh hm uh th cancer is everywhere uh so youre saying it might have done the sa ba thing but in a sort of more roundabout way its just that the uni except that the universe is such a complex phenomenon that its so deep its f f the fabric that we are witnessing through m science and through any known ability to understand mm is just a thin shell from how deep this phantasmagorical experience goes and that when they did that its possible that they started a chain reaction at such a subatomic level a sub sub sub sub subatomic level its gonna take a while to crumble that itll take a while before it it it r you know vr goes you know and just r it apart yeah it might take it might take a a few th it might take five hundred years or a thousand years yeah or a hundred years or maybe its be w maybe in v fifty years or it might never happen but its to me tha was scientific irresponsibility a w without the knowledge of of f what fractals symbolize at this point to me u uh they w they could make that decision easier and with the sci fractals could have made the de easier no no without the knowledge of fractals the decision was made easier if frac were known at that time oh there might have been a little more caution because there was theres this window but fractals dont uh dont imply any particular morals well they imply no they dont imply morals but they do imply that theres more than the obvious going on well all math does that uh not to me uh its theyre just another system thats all just another model its uh to me its a model its its a model into the fourth dimension as opposed to you know well actually the third dimension ein theory is a model in the fourth dimension and thats time um but fractal can be applied to many dimensions or n or just i mean any number of dimensions its basically taking something and dividing it up randomly or with some system its like nested nested values basically inside a gallon you have four quarts inside of four in inside a quart you have the certain amount of cups and then you know etcetera etcetera well i dont see how its yeah except its not its not uh its not so its not squa and its not as predictable as that i mean its uh its its not predictable at all really its its a its a found pheno well its not predictable if you apply random values to the subdivisions the subdivisions have to be random they ha it has to have randomness to it the order i dont think is is understood yet i mean i might be wrong but thats my understanding hm well i th thats why theyre calling it the equ theyre calling it uh the mathematics of chaos oh thats a different thing thats not fractals yeah thats fractals it includes other well fractals can be used to describe chaos it includes it includes other it i yes it can and it includes other mathematics too but fractals is separate yeah i mean and chaos is se uh they overlap mhm chaos i guess is basically analysis of noise for for the scientist for the scientist the scientist has never hav has never had a tool where he had that overlap you see hm see thats w thats the point that im trying to get at is is that because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap its giving them something that they never had before hm a tha is an opportunity for to meet spirituality yeah well theres u in physics theres oppor to meet spirituality twentyfour hours a day wherever you go just by being alive if they dont wanna see it theyre not gonna see it in fractals well yeah a lot of people will a lot of people will uh itll dawn on them because they follow the scientific impulse and fractals may be the very thing that boggles them out enough where they have to do some serious questioning about things is my theory yeah you know maybe theyll probably find it in something if there fractals werent there i think um its like all the the ideas that we have throughout the ages and the various theyre just sort of echos of uh the pa and they come under different names and things just like um the latest power now is corporations right and before that it was like uh governments before that it was principalities before that it was gangs you know and tri and gangs are coming back now you know s but uh god are they ever um its unbelievable and knowledge and an the pursuit of um spirituality has taken on many forms and if a person wants to find it in in something they believe in and they believe in science theyll find it in science well thats very true but i mean uh that i thi that that that people who find spirituality in science as their f sole spiritual source are people that are fucking up the planet you know i dont think science is the i dont think science can be god ive been watching two thousand and one lately you know i mean thats what thats all i thats not what its all about but thats a a major theme in it you know that the race between the human and the and the tech mhm and its and its technological manifestation of well i you know i think that we built its like are we gonna be part of it or are we gonna make it is it gonna m do us or are we gonna do it you know is our creation its like the frankenstein myth is our creation going to uh destroy us or are we going to continue yeah uh look at whats on tv yeah i just put it on man oh i just put it on okay yeah i see i thought they were showing that on the uh ads for some reason uh a little too hip for tv little too hip yeah so theyre colorcycling right now does it zoom later i guess it must yeah ive got zooms on here too and i whered you tape it from uh this ones fractal fantasy which is for sale hunh and the other one is uh fractal zooms which i dont think is available b and then ive got a uh test film from ibm laboratories of uh f uh uh taking a julia set into the fourth dimension hm which th and then they zoom through it its pretty f pretty fantastic looking they might not actually be be um back in the barn or from the barn yet good morning this is doctor naretto at the kingman vet service x x x x x x x i saw tad this morning yeah um hes looking not too ba um a little bit of pain in his abdomen its hard to know if he just has a gastritis or gastroenteritis from chewing on that dead pigeon or what the problem is um what we ended up doing was giving him some antibiotics and sending him home um if he does not improve we may need to take some xrays and hes got some bone or something in there i didnt feel anything in his belly but yeah a lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things theyll just get an upset stomach and um also a little bit of uh uh well just inflamation in in there and and just feel bad so um i you know since hes not vomiting now you can go ahead and feed him and stuff and see how he does um hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any any infection that he h that he might have gotten from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon um but if he if he doesnt get better or if he gets worse be sure and let us know well but already by tomorrow he should be feeling a lot better um and if he if he isnt or if he starts vomiting or having diarrhea we may need to see him we we w will need to see him again so um okay mhm youre welcome mm bye sh uh what did you what on your sheet what was the cost for the cast that you charged about what do we gen i think it was like fifty with the cast oh to put it on to actually put the cast on casting materials and then okay and then um she had pretty much when we rechecked her she was ready to take it off so we didnt have to do any more xrays or anything okay im trying to remember i think like with the white you got i thought you xrayed it you xrayed it with the cast on yeah mhm xx yeah yeah yeah and it was ready to come off and we took it off she did a real good job of keeping it keeping it clean and dry thats i think half the battle cause she didnt have any sores or anything when we took it off mm yeah kristen for the for the tranquilizer what do we what is it again ten ten i wonder if she would need more and itll be oh hell yeah for a casting to do a cast x xx biotal if you just biotal and metofane xxx we just or even well put him on the machine and then you dont have to worry about em what was what would that that would be thirteen total or thirteen extra no plus thir for anesthesia to put this cast on cause if you dont then y theyre waking up and you just its ba end up spend more time than if you just put em on the silly machine o yep as we know from the sheep well and from other things too just yeah are those good do you like em yeah did you make em i made em yeah ah i was thinking they were more like a chocolate chip cookie bar and then as i got through the recipe i noticed that they dont have any flour in em theyre good so theyre actually more like granola bars than they must have yeah cookie bars yeah theyve got brown sugar and butter and tastes like they have peanut butter oatmeal and peanut butter chips chocolate chips okay so a recheck would be about that much with the mhm xrays and then x x does that sound right thirtytwo i think uh if we she woke up we could w send her home tonight i wouldnt see why we couldnt send her home tonight would you if she wakes up fine oh well were gonna be biotaling her and oh sh if sh she probably wont though never mind never mind i was thinking im still thinking na na na na na na and she wont have any an uh antibiotics cause using all x x no and that thirtytwo what is this ten for anesthesia oh but theyre still opposite theyre opposite yeah that looks all right dont you think we should charge them an extra eightee for the distemper vaccine trent does it no i felt horrible doing that on that eye dog that he had in here last week under whatever night it was cause he had down twentyfive plus eighteen and what can you do when hes already got it down jeez uh well well all we did i cant do that cause all we did was i was in here and put a bandage on yeah yeah um did you get hold of dan then yeah hes x lets see six let me see fiftysix let me see we need one of these and one of these one of those and one of those and two of those x three sent home with amoxi x fiftythree and pred so well se how yeah well ill call him probably late this afternoon to make sure hes all right x xx x x xx there no i was just trying to figure out what we spent already mm mm let see xxxxxx weve already spent fifty for him and i want him to spend another hundred well but thats better than pins right and surgery which would be another two hundred or yeah its more for a surgery to spend any pretty much any time you can and that one really you know i dont think it would benefit from pins mm because wed have to undo it i mean wed have to well wed have to go we could we could try it closed mhm but still its more expensive i think itll do fine with a cast especially since its a spiral fracture and its not displaced and its not displaced should be pretty stable itll be kind of a pain getting the well maybe not getting the cast over the stifle maybe not well as long as shes got kinda long legs as long as shes quiet okay ill give him a call i dont know if hes in the barn from home in back in from the barn yet or not xxxxxxxx well x called both the house number and the barn number and both of em and a little kid answered mm yeah and theyre little little kids too xx xxxx mhm xx theyre like xx xx on three yeah carol its marcia hi um we got xrays done already and i was gonna let you know what what was going on should i talk to richard or you okay okay um it looks like shes got a spiral fracture of um of her tibia which is the bone between the knee and the hock a u its f its really looks pretty stable its not displaced very far uh anyway and its um pretty much you know locked in place so to speak um so i think that she would she would do fine with a cast u a i pretty much got an estimate so far with the coming in yesterday and the xrays and everything the bill was about fiftyfour and to do a cast um with the anasthesia and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff and then the casting material probably the uh its gonna be about a hundred and fiftythree total a the only then it would be the only extra would be in about six to eight weeks wed have her come in again we would tranquilize her and take the xrays and see if its h enough to take off and thats generally about thirtyfour to forty somewhere in there yeah you know a pin you know if we did a pin its probably it would probably be even a hundred more but so its its thats about the at this point the the least expensive alternative that probably will work for her um so if you want to let him know and then have him call me back if you lindsey if you wanna go ahead and do it okay you wanna put this kitty castration down sure xxx alright and if she you know if we did it she could probably go home tomorrow okay whenever whenever you get a chance okay thanks carol mhm byebye gee this is the one that was too young and went back home x x x shes shes gonna talk to him and get back to me i imagine they might oh youve grow he gets it just right hes just getting his adult xx what a cuty oh youre beautiful xxxxxx pretty unusual with that xxxx hey beautiful xxxxxx oh youre beautiful xx x oh yes xxx thats what it sounds like it kind of sounds like that sounds like it with the ticking is that the needle kingman vet center heidi speaking yeah xx it hurt you felt the needle aw x x yeah okay is this a dog weve seen before gonna call back yeah i talked to carol okay how old is it and shes gonna talk to richard and okay just a moment xx ill let you talk to one of the vets i imagine they might go for it its about the cheapest alternative in the world jeremiah hassel you stay right here with me is on the phone what and theyve got a dog in about three weeks and she was dripping some blood saturday night hes wondering what it may be and they wa mmm they must have got a replacement for faith already i dont know whos that that called jere hassel hassel you stay here il l be right ba could it be aborting yeah could be whos aborting jeremiah hassels they got a dog thats pregnant and jee i heard them due in three weeks and their dogs dripping blood and theyre wondering why i heard and i thought it was him he didnt give his name but i heard a kid o p whatever that shopping thing is on the radio prime mo prime mover on saturday morning saying that they had a few puppies left that they were gonna sell and then theyre taking orders for christmas puppies and i thought thats probably who that was last week or x guess they gotta make money somehow huh oh saturday night want one of these well with all not before i gradu well theyre really concerned about these proposals on the ballot for next week or two weeks from now or whenever it is next week i guess mom do i really have to go through and r read this to make sure that i didnt leave out any of my sentences or any you need to make progress not go back over what youve already done okay because out of the eight that ive done i notice on one of them i skipped two sentences they werent really important but i did skip two of em and so now im paranoid that im gonna skip a bunch more so i have to go back and proofread does it matter not at this point you should be making progress okay your ten minutes are up and ive proofread the whole thing uh how many pages do you have to copy excuse me just two more actually that okay im gonna check on you in ten minutes if you havent gotten one page done in ten minutes youll go one side of a page it takes me a long time because ive got to go over the sentences figure out if im gonna rewrite them or leave them the same and just write them out well y i cant write them exactly the way they are because they stink then you need to go downstairs and finish it im fine melissa its nine oclock im not gonna do any better downstai its nine oclock in the evening you also have algebra to do i can skip algebra no you cant no you alright fine ill do my algebra then no you ge take that downstairs right now ho ho honey you need to be able to concentrate and get it done and dont argue youve visited with ron and youll also see him on the weekend so what well that was rude you know she knows it too she did it on purpose take it downstairs or are you listening are you gonna add like the little lines that jut out of these get your pen back from that yeah uh its erasable and i am not marking on it i dont care if its erasable dont touch it i didnt i know dont thats actually very good lettering sir i know this is your fi mo you gave me another ten minutes warning no i didnt no no longer i have retracted it you argued with me long enough i changed my mind okay i retract all my arguing i totally agree i should go downstairs now can i stay up here no doesnt work in this household you may use my desk well wait a minute its a royal mess isnt it yes it is youll just have to carefully set things aside sym and ill go through the piles a we can go down there and si dun dadadum at my earliest convenience dadadadun dun dadada you wanna go down there and si dundundundun dun dada no xxxxx you guys i wanna be able to be with you did dad watch perot so do last night unh i dont think so and recorded the game i figured hed be interested in hearing him at least excuse me well his minds made up uh well i know that but it might just be fun t to listen to him one thing is never bring up politics with my grandpa hutch because youll get in a big family ar excuse me and mom or no was it grandpa flynn well anyway either way it is not pleasant to talk about it with either one of em uh either way believe me i made some comment i made some s comment like why are you voting for them or something like that and then uh they went on for like an hour or the whole dinner time which was probably fortyfive minutes about the political views and a this other stuff and they just talked about it on and on and on and on and on and so mom told me never ever to ask maybe ill have tea anything about that again could you grab me a box of tea that was grandpa flynn i asked him something about the democratic plat like what all do they believe oh here we got this ill just use that dumb question its not pleasant to talk about politics with anyone who doesnt believe uh d not believe but doesnt agree with you vote in the same way that you vote or whatever xx i dont vote its hardly ever pleasant so it has a real way of stifling conversation and its just like tonight at that inservice uh noble whatever her name is was sitting on this side and she says something about angie noble clinton angie noble and about i forget what she said you know about supporting clinton and and was just kind of something about that and donna here and there she says well i dont know she says im gonna vote for the other guy its like end of conversation lets just be quiet folks i dont wanna hear any more missis nobles definitely very democratic mo i going because shes prochoice anyway i think that isnt not a good reason to base your decision though x x see i didnt miss anything good then i can get one of our great erasers and just go wh why is there a exclamation point there isnt one anymore cause its its going to be erased oh i see cause its not symphony its symphony like that what are you gonna do with this thing brett draw on uh where theres erasers in there we got to go to the symphony saturday night yeah theres another one though the better one somebody is in here wasnt using their tickets doesnt tear and gave em to us and we heard chi ki korean uh violinist hm who makes his living from doing this m i think hes really good oh hm boy really good understatement so it was pretty neat we hadnt been to a concert in i dont know when uh this symphony does pretty good for being a little one horse southwestern michigan symphony you know it and vodnoy the conductors been here now its been uh eigh years i wanna go see the kalamazoo symphony sometime its been okay whats the symphony called here ill well they call it i think they call it southwestern michigan symphony now hm they do uh because they draw a lot of people from you know like music teachers from kalamazoo and m who play in it you mean yeah who play in it mhm and uh i remember hearing some guys complaining like years ago when we first moved here they call it twin cities but they let all these people come in and take over all the first chairs and all this stuff unhunh you know x so they changed it and uh dont put that on the floor try to take it to a wastebasket cause theres so much okay they did a pretty nice job you know and we got this new xx center out here are all those major positions paid auditorium is everyone who plays in that symphony paid they dont get paid much yes but they get paid a little but they have to belong to the musicians union a its not really high paying i mean its sel you cant live off of it no no its it i think for per i know somebody who makes a living as a d musician i think its so much an hour for performances hm i dont think they i dont think they get paid for all that rehearsal time my cello teacher i could ask john nelson makes his living off of hed know playing the cello but hes but see hes a teacher though he makes his money teaching he teaches saturdays in verrian springs and here mhm and he and he plays in im pretty sure he made it into the kalamazoo orchestra does he teach just cello what is that uh does he teach just cello yeah you cant teach more than one instrument and make it really well if you teach and you have a lot of students you can you can only be good at really really good i think could get x x at one instrument yeah you have to be you have to focus at once really be able to work its hard getting the clientele yeah it sounds like this is strictly you know like on a school year strictly a weekend of course he comes down here on the week i suppose he has afternoon evening or whatever students maybe up in kalamazoo im sure he practices to every day maybe he goes different places maybe he hes in kalamazoo but like well if he c comes here maybe he goes some place else does he live in kal not too far yeah yeah oh so he may go yeah so he could go may say maybe go to battle creek on a afternoon per uh hunh after school hours you know its hard telling he seems like a prety nice guy though does he teach in the school system too or mm hes strictly pri hes not married or anything and i think strictly private lessons a orchestra hm just totally cello i thought maybe he was a music teacher too but but did you tell me he wasnt hes not did you ask him somebody else i dont know how a person can do it but he did an m hm hm m hm ive got to start working on my grade cards too just so i dont i wont get em all done friday afternoon if i dont get started approximately here du du du du du du du and staff meeting tomorrow after school duh daduh hm hm hm hm hm hm do you know that melissa gets a something tomorrow night aca letter award academic oh academic letter are we going to that yes what time is that at i have no idea i dont even know what im supposed to wear xx i dont even know what it is am i getting a little uh yellow s you just dress nice or am i getting like a diploma type thing or i mean not a diploma a letter i think is one of those letters but you put on a jacket a varsity jacket i know like the athletes ge but do they hand me the letter or do they hand me a certificate mhm or i think you a ribbon or what i thi you ge the le but uh the thing is i dont even know what to wear just dress nice i think ill wear my white dress with the black diamonds its okay with me um not to be critical seven thirty but isnt that awfully thin melis no just bug off alright forget it its a small cello its not regular size duh seven thirty at the high school uh theres even a guest speaker oh joy do i have to go mom crie no you can stay home and do your homework well he also has club to night oh thats right you got your club tomorrow night i think he should have to come i had to go to his soccer game awana is that what you said unhunh yech its terribly lopsided i need to do something about it oh well i dont have time right now im not even in for that right now i have to draw a stupid figure thats the problem i didnt wanna do any figure i have to draw a stupid person that has to be twelve inches tall at least you could draw yoyo ma if you know what he looks like what am i gonna do draw this guy singing there and then have his eyes go nnn is yoyo ma chinese i guess with a name like yoyo no yoyo ma is a normal american name he could have been swedish hi my names yoyo ma yoyo ma yoyo mazhin x comes from the old country aurorgia bourghealis yumpin yiminy my straightedge if i like went like this would it here is my straightedge stop it no this is my only straightedge see lets say thats approximately approximaitaly the a the approximation of approx are you trying to get that to go through the middle of your drawing is a p r o x mhm and i dont feel like measuring something doesnt look right whoa where did this offcenter hunh youll have to draw your self twelve inches high ha ha with a cello in your hand sitting down hm with a cello in your hand cellos are a bit big for that sort of like xxx you could practically do that with a quartersized violin fit it in your hand bob came by this afternoo bob who um ash ashtone and uh he has his miter thing he took it unhunh why cause its hi its i was gonna call him and tell him im not quite finished with it well hes got windows hes doing some things yeah he has rotting windows and he has to replace the wood oh he rotting windows well it looks like im not gonna do that well i cant do it this weekend any you werent gonna do it this week yeah he said we could what should i wear for halloween be quiet were not talking about it now well x sit here and i you got work to do be quiet were not talking about it im gonna go check my cello wheres my cello my cello xxxx x it comes down to approximately right about there o boop what day is tomorrow the twentyninth oh by the way mom oh joy um oh joyous young life is at amy and andy richards tonight tonight gee thanks for telling us at eight oclock xx okay its ni te theyd still be over there and the thing is no see ron they live three blocks away get your work done dear they w they live three blocks away who does mhm and young life is over there good for them and so it would make most sense for me to have gone over there im such an idiot oh well whos whos itll be there sometime richard richards well youll be even more of an idiot if you dont get your work done amy richards so why dont you uh ah have the problem so what did you say about me get your work done but what before that get your work done old lady actually young girl oh boy ho ho hum oh boy this time change is just getting to me no im just kidding its really fifteen after ten thats not late i guess thats true yeah but we uh also got up an hour later than usual uh course thats not saying much i think its the end of that excuse dear the time has changed its when he awaked is that a word no when he awoke uh awoke what about awakened you can tell her grammar is not ah you could probably use that at its highest level of maturity well it says it says i bet it was fun for him when he awaked at the silence and blah blah blah lah xx something like that uh when he awaked when he awoke yeah i bet it was fun for him when he awoke at the silence he awokeded at the silence and he got to hear cousin simmons and the reverend saying fine things about him have you guys ever imagined yourself dead just to see what people would think about you no would you just and what they would say about you continue your work ron i do that a lot did you know annette uh dill kruger annette dill un kru its kru no bev x not bev dills s you know theres bev dill a jea di from napier you know and then theres jason di i dont remember any of them and ac oh okay jason dill okay is he related did know no yeah yeah past tense she died very suddenly yeah shes what how old thirty two thirtysix thirty hm uh theyre on the mis field in afri yeah yeah oh when she died and out in out in tribal tribal villages although they were in the city mhm at the time right right in town but ap it was either a heart attack or an aneurysm hm and they suspect an aneurysm it was extremely quick i guess hm mom said it was a cerebral hemorrhage which is an an but i suppose theyre the same yeah they are but since im not a doctor hm but i but mom said thats what it was but i dont know she could be wrong and they werent going to do an autopsy they figured it would serve no useful purpose hm it had to be one of the two they figured ill color this in at school xxxxx at school you can color it in yeah so anyway that was real sudden cause they have the big markers last week last thursday as a matter of fact hm well how are you gonna make the strings are you gonna leave the little white areas this past wednesday im just gonna make the lines here what do you say ill do some what which sounds better i bet it was fun for him when he awoke or i bet it was fun for him when he awakened awo x try a oh thats helpful uh well ill say awakened cause thats what i have written down just watch hell put a note by it note by that i really like that word melissa leave me alone and you you could say my father gave me that word i would have put awaked but really i think everyone in this family should read this book but i really it would be you would enjoy it brett yes im sure gee arent we in a nice mood today yes we are im all cheerful hm hmhm oh boy x xxxxx xx we could make well starting in november were gonna be looking at the sky i have a day by day november calendar of where to look and what to look for as in planets its pretty neat looking do you have a telescope well no i just naked eye stuff he has a telescope though well its uh easier to do naked eye oh well gee multiplies forty times or or binoc oops it does pretty good when you can find the moon the only thing is well its just not a quality instrument brett its impossible to find anything our binoculars would be just as well worth taking hello ron lets go and sit in the living room we did this thing about we were talking about how in science books and you see the solar system how its s out of scale and uh you cannot get a scale for d distance and at the same time get objects that can give you the scale for the size of the planets nice x but were trying to do a scale for they had this thing drawn for a scale for uh distance mhm so we started at one end of the hallway with a roll of toilet paper oh unhunh and it has so many sheets of toilet paper and you roll out and so you go so many and we were way down the hall like fourhundred and eightythree you know s pieces of toi toilet sheets later where were you yeah that you could have that l for jupiter for jupiter how far were you to do that distance like how wide it is diameter fourhundred and eightythree like fourandahalfinch squares of toilet paper no but down the where were you in the hall what hall in in your school well it was at fair plain west school is that the junior high and that we go by xx no no its just an ele school to grandmas but then x starting from the s then we went about i think it was th maybe thirtyseven you know sheets to mercury then he says mhm now the size of mercury would be and he had a staple would be like this you know hole of that through the paper you know that about that not no bigger than that mhm wow we and we got out to earth and i think it was a paperclip size you know to punch through or something you know just to kind of give us an idea of how big was the sun did they say it was a softball he had a softball sitting there oh if the sun were this softball unhunh then the size of these other ones would be something like that when we got out to jupiter xx it would have been the size of the ho in the middle of a record hunh thats mighty large comparatively you mean a single r a single or a l a large uh the oh gee in an lp im sure yeah i thought it was just an lp yeah because otherwise well compared to earth being a staple yeah uh paperclip ho hole or paperclip hole what was pluto pluto must have been well i have the i oh i had the infor outside the hole that you just punch with a paperclip ill have to look yeah yeah oh the hole it would be that kind of dia oh wow and the di of a staple xxxx mm mhm for mercury yeah my arms falling asleep hm my butt fell asleep ear so it was kind of interesting cause i was sitting here so long never had that happen before anyway ts your butt falls asleep you try and stand up i have this whole paragraph written xx and now that i look at it theres a m better way of uh doing it structurally just well then redo it because i put this big parenthesy here create stress well what i might as well have done create stress onto yourself cause see i have he awakened at the silence and he got to hear this and this and this and i interrupted with he awakened at the silence parenthesy the author does such a good job of describing this and everything else especially adams feelings and he got to hear it totally totally breaks the paragraph and i should have just put this together and then put the author does a great job of describing the silence and then did that but i dont have time to rewrite it do i maybe its too distracting here no no and we should go in the living roo and no because i would have done this anyway why dont you and ron come back into the living room instead no be a rebel stay here i wanna work on this yeah lets go back out there that way no your you guys can overhear listen there are just you go ahead youre doing alright whats that brett somebodys head from behind yeah its the conduc what is this nice to have you could try to draw vodnoy from behind get his picture xx yeah like where am i going to get vodnoys picture i dont know if its due tomorrow off of xxx its not due tomorrow xx thank goodness or else id be up till midnight working on this dumb thing this is quite a picture melissa had hey brett xxxx can you move your chair the photo ron what quite a photograph melissa had here of granddad hunh yeah she showed me all that stuff of grandpa yeah i thought it was pretty neat and that she won that was even more remarkable we often meditate i think on the love of christ and there are many ways to do it and those who have meditated on the love of christ have often done so in terms of the cross itself have imagined again and afresh uh his uh bleeding wounds uh see him as he died on the cross but wherever we turn uh in considering the love of christ we turn always to the gospel records dont we we we turn to the word of god we turn to the real jesus as hes described and uh there there is where our meditation always centers that we might know him and uh see the wonder of his love and not only hear him as he cries why have you forsaken me but uh see him also in his seeking love as the risen lord uh see him uh with that fish breakfast by the lake of galilee broiling fish dont you like that you know he had that uh he had that breakfast all cooking while the disciples were still out in the boat and then uh of course he has a special interview with peter not the first time hed seen him he made a special resurrection appearance uh to peter but uh there in the morning early morning in the lake of galilee and there are cocks crowing in the distance and jesus says to peter do you love me more than these simon son of jonah do you love me more than these three times the question because you see as uh we were saying a bit ago the love and the service go together dont they if peter is to be restored in service he has to be restored in love and when peter says uh i love you then jesus says uh feed my sheep tend my lambs care for my little ones we we cant love others in the name of christ unless the love for others is a overflow of our love for the lord himself the people that were called to love are unfortunately not uh warrantably lovable uh we uh uh the source of our love is not how appealing they are although we can praise god for his image in them and rejoice in the many evidences of gods common grace in their lives but nevertheless uh basically the the fountain of our love i is uh the seeking love of the savior the selfdenying love that is uh willing to serve in his name do you love me you know uh jesus didnt ask peter those questions to undercut his love or his faith he asked those questions to establish it and uh jesus does the same with you my friend he does the same he does ask you this morning do you love me do you really love me but he asks it in order that youll be able to say at last with peter lord you know everything you know my heart and lord you know that in spite of everything yes lord i do love you well the saving love of uh the father and the son is also the saving love of the spirit and thats why i read that section from romans eight uh you see gods love is is present in the spirit uh there theres a wonderful theology of the spirit in uh in the scriptures uh uh especially of course in the new testament um bultmann in his uh commentary on uh romans eight uh uh talks about uh the two ways in which the spirit i is spoken of and uh uh he unfortunately uses anthropological terms to describe it uh he talks about uh the the the spirit in uh the sense of mana as in uh animism where the spirit you have a spirit of of a tree or a a stone or something like that and then you have the more personal concept of the spirit uh uh both an impersonal and a personal concept of the spirit now i d i dont care for his analogy but uh the point is well taken uh the point is that paul does speak of the spirit both as possessor and as possessed you see the spirit possesses us uh as christians we are not demon possessed we are holy spirit possessed and uh holy spirit possession has a close relationship to demon possession uh the close relationship is what makes it so different uh you see uh demon possession is always destructive because uh satan cant create and the demonpossessed man in gadare remember uh he couldnt even give his na when jesus asked him what his name was uh he his personality was destroyed you know how c s lewis has done that in his uh uh adult novels uh uh but uh there it is uh s uh demon possession is personality destructive it depersonalizes because uh satan can only corrode he cant create he can only destroy but holy spirit pos session is no less real possession only it has the op posite effect the holy spirit you see is the cre ator spirit who brought uh order out of chaos the holy spirit is the one who orders the holy spirit is the one who frees uh liberates uh the uh the the the gadarene demoniac thought he was free because nobody could tie him up you see he could go anywhere do anything uh absolute freedom right uh and he could treat people he hi he didnt have to dress any particular way no dress code and so he stripped it all off and the he uh he could uh d treat people any way he wanted to so whenever they came by he beat them up and uh uh and uh then if there was nobody handy to beat up he picked up a stone and uh tore his own flesh apart theres demonic liberty but uh holy spirit liberty doesnt work that way see uh uh now uh um youll accuse me of thinking uh of holy spirit liberty in too strictly presbyterian terms because uh i remind you that that man once he was delivered was seated clothed and in his right mind uh and uh and well pass over other uh uh scriptural ac like the lame man healed by the beautiful gate at the temple who went in leaping and dancing and praising the lord see that uh thats a little different but but uh uh you presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order uh but but the holy spirit remember is the spirit of both right hes the spirit of order hes the spirit of ardor and and the holy spirit uh uh uhuh is the one uh who has uh ordered our lives and as he possesses us he orders us and he gives us the order of love if you love me jesus said keep my commandments uh i wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment the obedience of love but the holy spirit is the one who orders our lives uh controls our lives is in possession of our lives but the holy spirits also given to us see hes not only the possessor hes also the one who is possessed we possess him he dwells in our hearts uh we have not only the gifts of the spirit in the plural but we have the gift of the spirit we have the holy spirit himself given to us the promise of the father uh they the disciples were to wait until that great promise was given the gift of the holy spirit and so the holy spirit given to us uh f works in us uh that sense of the presence of gods love and thats why uh paul says in romans five that god pours out his love in our hearts by the holy spirit now uh there the love thats poured out does not describe the love that we have for go although that is the fruit of the spirit you know love joy peace so on uh but uh in that passage in romans five paul isnt talking about uh the gift of love that we have for god hes talking about the gift of love that god has for us because he goes on to describe that love of god god commends his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us so its gods love for us thats poured out in our hearts by the holy spirit given to us uh which is uh again uh a wonderful reality because if god didnt do that uh we wouldnt have a love for god theres no spring of that divine love within us it comes from him and it does come from him and he does give it and so the spirit is the spirit of uh adoption the spirit of sonship now to be the spirit of sonship he has to be also the spirit of fatherhood right uh to make us a ware that we are children of god uh we have to know that he is our father and so it is the love of god made real to our hearts the knowledge that he does love us that he is present with us that uh becomes of course then the source of our uh love toward him um uh friends uh theres theres nothing more important for the whole balance and stability and progress and growth of our christian lives than uh to realize again and again and again the uh the wonder of our union with jesus christ through the spirit because its in jesus christ that we are united to the father and it is by the spirit that christ is present in our hearts and its by the spirit that the father is present in our hearts two aspects of union with christ i i think you all know this theology but it always pays to think about it again the representative union the vital union the representative union the basis of our salvation when christ died we died because he died for us he died as our representative he died in our place uh he died as uh uh the one uh uh who bore our sins in his own body on the tree so he was our representative right and he represented us not only as paul teaches not only when he died for us but when he rose for us and then he ascended into the heavenly places and where he is we are and thats why paul says in ephesians that we are in the heavenly places in christ jesus why representatively where he is we are now thats a tremendously important of course foundational lifetransforming truth its happened see you a a a new creature in christ because youre united to him you ha triumphed over sin and death you ha died to sin and pauls reasoning about how we ought to live is always grounded in that uh you know in colossians uh its because christ rose that we are to seek the things which are above you are risen with christ seek the things which are above because you died with christ therefore mortify sin in your members put to death sin because it has died in other words the imperative is always grounded in the indicative because of what christ did for us therefore uh we live out of the fact the reality the accomplishment of his perfect work and dont forget jesus not only paid the price of your sins but remember that he lived a perfect life for you that the white robe of righteousness that you wear in that last day is the robe of christs righteousness so its all that christ did for you uh uh uh jesus was baptized for you uh let it be done to fill all righteousness the righteousness he had to fill for you see he he did it all for you but then of course the other side of it is its not only representative its also vital jesus christ is the vine and we are the branches y were united to him our life is drawn from christ there is the uh uh not only the the the legal uh aspect of that which christ did for us as our representative there is the vital aspect of what christ does in us as he lives in us and dwells in us and has fellowship with us and and we walk with him uh uh every uh y y you know i uhuhuh its uh its been long fashionable in theological circles to uh sniff at the hymn uh i walked in the garden alone while the dew was still on the roses you know uh all this uh romantic business and uh and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn and yet everybody perversely seems to love it uh well uh uh i i i think i think the reason its so loved in spite of its uh uh uh theological vacuity uh is that its uh experientially uh uhuh pretty much on target weve all known those uh precious times of uh of genuine fellowship with the lord that uh uh that uh we can describe only with great difficulty and uh its true you see uh we are vitally united to jesus christ uh we do know him and the knowledge that we have of him is the knowledge of love uh we just simply love him uh we uh uh ow the mystics the christian myth mystics l love to talk about uh weve got some kind of time constraint here what uh uh uh what w w w when do we i think when i think were done when you are so well i i gotta be finish what you have to say i i well ill i yeah let me try to finish what im talking about here but but uh there there i dont often get chance to talk to types like you you know its wonderful uh its particularly wonderful cause i know you know everything im saying anyway s so you can smile affirmatively and that encourages me thats great uh but but uh but uh really the the that uh you know the christian mystics talked about climbing jacobs ladder and uh uh you you youd come up the ladder and when you get at the top you fling yourself down at the very gate of heaven and maybe uh maybe the gate will open y you cant control it you dont know when it will open but maybe it will open and when it opens then uh its uh light bursting in your inner heart and uh once youve had that experience youd give anything to have the experience repeated and so uh you go through any amount of discipline and uh try out different forms of discipline and uh you recite the jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of mount athos and uh and uh sooner or later uh you think it may happen uh the uh you you may gain that experience well now uh you know there are experiences of ecstasy tha uh that can be induced by a transformation of consciousness and uh i think christians sometimes have uh uh mingled that uh psychological experience uh whether its the left part or or the right part of the brain taking over or something uh i dont think um uh the um the psychologists are as sure as they once were or even the neurologists about how some of those things happen but uh uh at any rate uh uh you see uh it isnt that we have to climb the ladder and uh im im sorry that that whole episode with jacob got misunderstood all because uh all because of the hebrew preposition al that uh wasnt taken account of uh that see uh he he stood uh upon not it ee he uh jacob st saw the stairway not a painters ladder of course but a a tower of babel type of thing a uh a zigarot r right you got a zigarot and which was made for the gods to touch down at the top and then they could come down uh to the bottom you know it was like a little heliport for the gods there that was he idea but but uh th they theyd come down thered be a temple at the bottom and then uh the god could be with the people but uh uh but it it wasnt that that god that that uh jacob saw god at the top of the ladder up in heaven uh god stood uh upon him uh the the masculine uh there the uh v v v vowel with the little dot over it you know the the the holem uh he he hes uh uh uh he stood upon hi uh which is the common hebrew expression and you know thats what it is because the second time when god appeared to b uhuh uh uh j jacob at bethel uh the same expression is used he went up from upon him see uh its the same expression so god had come down the ladder thats what we miss he wasnt standing up there at the top uh he came down the ladder and uh uh when he came down the ladder he stood over jacob and revealed himself to jacob and thats why jacob said this is the house of god this is the gate of heaven it was the house of god he said because god was in this place and i didnt know it see it its this is bethel here because here god has come to us so god was revealing himself to jacob and god reveals himself to us he comes to us and uh he seeks us as we seek him and our love is always in response to his love and its the assurance that your god loves you that he seeks you that hes with you that he comes to you its this assurance that draws you to repentance and draws you to faith and draws you to himself um the uh uh salvation is of the lord and uh its the lords love who quickens your love well im not going to say uh th the rest of the things i i had in mind to say but uh i uh you can fill out the talk for me would you please sometime the the commitment of love the obedience of love if you love me keep my commandments um uh remember uh marys adoration uh when she uh brought the spikenard and uh opened it and poured it out on the feet of jesus just before he went to the cross and judas criticized her remember uh because he said this could have been given to the poor uh he he he was the first oldfashioned liberal dont worship jesus but help the poor uh but uh uh y you see uh uh w what what was the answer what was the answer that jesus uh gave uh uh n let her do this let her keep it not in the sense of preserving the ointment she was pouring it out but in the sense of observing it observing a a an observance against his burial uh so she realized what his death meant and she realized who he was he said the poor you have with you always but me you have not always a tremendous assurance of his own deity who else could say something like that hunh but jesus said it and uh uh you see what that says to us uh if our lord were here then we could pour out perfume on his feet hes not here but who is the poor you have with you always so whose feet can we anoint the feet of the poor in his name see uh love uh uh doesnt mean uh uh uh climbing up jacobs ladder uh to the heavenlies uh where nobody else can be around the love of god is experienced in the community of the saints its experienced as we all reached out reach out to the breadth and the length and the height and the depth and the love of god is experienced in the course of service a i heard you describe some of these service projects that uh um intervarsity is involved in and friends um these these projects even if uh theyre working about rebuilding old houses or whatever they are not things that have nothing to do with love they a works of love they are the evidence of that love of god in our hearts uh they are the fruit that is borne by the tree that has the roots down into the water of gods refreshing grace and love and uh the mystical heights of christian devotion ought never to be separated from the realities of uh christian service the uh there was a hymn in the old intervarsity hymnal its not in the new one by xx xx a hymn that i love v very much talks about how we go with jesus through the desert and through uh the sufferings and the trials of this life and uh its very last verse is uh he who in his hour of sorrow bore the curse alone i who through the lonely desert trod where he had gone he and i in that bright glory one deep joy shall share mine to be forever with him his that i am there my friends in the wonder of gods love hes pleased with you god who looked at his own son and his heart rejoiced his heart rejoices this morning in your praise in your worship in the service of your hands in the love of your heart shall we pray our heavenly father we cannot find words to express our love for you because we are overwhelmed by your love for us lord jesus how may we speak to you of that which you give to us spirit of god how we praise you that when we do not know what to pray as we should you make intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered and o lord receive we pray this morning the incense of

there hey have you ever been afraid of anything you know i remember some things i was afraid of all of us have been afraid of something havent we or somebody yeah you know i remember uh when i was a kid and uh maybe paulll remember this but we uh we had this one we lived in a a small cottage in back of a threetenement house on uh prospect street in lynne number twentyeight you remember that paul and uh it was it was kind of a small house upstai it had uh one large bedroom actually two large bedrooms which my mom and dad slept in and the other bedroom uh it was all us five boy in that one bed with two beds whoa you know and my sister had her own room cause shes the on girl x but it was a little smaller so we had uh we had this one big bedroom and there was two beds in the room so that meant three of us slept in one bed and two of us slept in the other bed and uh i remember those days i remember those days uh uh being with those guys trying to get the covers and many days i woke up with no covers you know what i mean and one of my brothers wet the bed so i mean it was like ugh ugh one of those days you woke up cold and a little damp you know oh thats kind of gross isnt it well thats how i grew up but in this bedroom um maybe thats why i turned out this way i dont know just kind of crazy you know from a young age i guess but in that in that uh b was a closet yep well pauls saying oh yeah i remember that closet you know and this clo was there and it was this incr closet and uh every night before i went to bed i wanted to make sure that closet door was closed oh yeah cause i knew if that closet door was open i wasnt gonna sleep cause inside that closet there was a nasty ol boogyma right paul xxxxx and i was afraid of that boogy you know during the day id go in there and look around and see if i could find him and id be amidst the shoe and all the junk and stuff in there and he wasnt there but at nigh thats where his home was and i was s of that yeah were you afraid of him paul as well i dont know were you afraid of that closet x yeah he was too so id never asked him that before so ill have to ask my other brothers as well you know i remember some other things i was afraid of i remember at times uh we grew up in a navyh neighborhood that was multiracial and uh some of us didnt get along and it was always interesting that when you got into trouble you ended up dealing with a number of kids besides just one so i know of several times i had an uh a kid that was after me and uh he would bring all his friends and thered be about ten kids waiting for me after school cause i went to a different school than they went to and they got out earlier than we did uhoh so its kinda like uhoh m there they are what am i gonna do and they cant come in the schoolyard you know cause the adultsll put em out but theyre out there waiting saying were gonna get you walt were gonna get you you know were after you and and uh and what i would do is go all the way around jumping fences going through yar you know ducking down behind cars so those guys couldnt get me cause i was afraid i knew what was gonna happen those guys were gonna beat the tar out of me its a good reason to be afraid isnt it i think so smart throwing rocks at you and things like that but anyway there was a time that eventually eventually i couldnt ru eventually i had to d with my f and confro yep those people i still did get the daylights beat out of me and uh but i confronted my fear you know i wanna talk a little bit about f today x uh cause i believe its something that keeps us uh from doing everything we can do as human beings the potential that god has given us and i believe it also really keeps us from a s s walk with god lets open to mark chapter uh five verse thirtyfive that day when evening came he said to his disciples let us go over to the other side leaving the crowds behind they took him along just as he was in the boat there were also other boats with him a furious squall came up and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion hey ma the disciples woke him and said to him teacher dont you care if we drown he got up rebuked the wind and said to the waves quiet be still then the wind died down and it was completely calm he said to his disciple why are you so afraid do you still ha no faith they were terrified and asked each other who is this even the wind and the waves obey him lets go on well they went across the lake to the region of geras uh gerasenes when jesus got out of the boat a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him i dont think he walked up and shook his hand were gonna see that in a second this man lived in the tombs and no one could bi him anymore not even with a chain for he had often been chained hand and foot but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet no one was strong enough to subdue him night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones when he saw jesus from a distance he ran and fell on his knees in front of him he shouted at the top of his voice what do you want with me jesus son of the most high god swear to god that you wont torture me for jesus had said to him come out of this man you evil spirit then jesus asked him what is your name my name is le he replied for we are many and he begged jesus again and again not to send them out into the area a large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside the demons begged jesus send us among the pigs allow us to go into them he gave them permission and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs aa the herd about two thousand in number rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside and the people went out to see what had happened when they came to jesus they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there dressed in his right mind and they were afraid those who had seen it told the people what had happened t what had happened to the demonpossessed man and he told about the pigs as well then the people began to plead with jesus to leave their region and im gonna stop right there you know as we look at this we see tha the disciple were afrai they were terrified of what had happened in the boat you know what its like to be terrified have you ever been terri i mean thats a pretty scary thing isnt it being terrifie is a very very scary word especially if youve experienced it maybe you were in a car wreck one time i was in a car wreck coming back from indianapolis one time we were going sixty miles an ho and were going down the freeway and all of a sudden this woman pulls out of the ramp trailor truck hits his brakes he s hes hes behind u i thought hes coming through us another person smashes us were spinning around the highway g is flying everywhere and im saying lord take me quickly i was scared to death i was terrified we ended up in the middle of the median uh a i had to crawl out through a window to get out of the car i was terrified i know that feeling tha wh the disciples were feeling at that time they were terrified they didnt understand what was going on and then we see the demonpossessed man he was u really think about how possessed he really was he was strong enough to break irons yep on his wrists and to free himself from the shackles that were on his feet and he cried out in the evening and cut himself with stones i mean he was a pretty wild guy wasnt he yep but jesus took good care of him he gave him back his sanity amen he gave him back his mind yep and the people came out to see what had happened cause they heard about the pigs and they came out it says they were afraid too they were afraid just like the disciples were afraid they were afraid and they asked je to leave the region you know its amazing but that fear because they didnt understand and they wanted to control the situation you know fear is o crippling xx i mean it just knocks on our door every single day every single day we get up it knocks on our door amen we all have different fears it kind of pulls us in it entraps us it keeps us from moving we become immobile and that truly i what was happening to the people their response was no thi this is incredible this is the son of god look at the great miracle that hes performed hes given this man peace hes given this man sanity hes given this man life again and were grateful to you jesus were happy jesus were excited about what youre doing here please stay with us forever well feed you well take care of you well become your friends well sit at your feet well pray with you well learn from you wrong jesus you just need to leave our region cause they were afraid mhm because they didnt understand and they were no longer in control but jesus was in control they realized that what jesus had done no other man could possibly do that there was something different about jesus thats right but their fear kept them from finding out exactly who jesus was does your fear keep you from knowing exactly who jesus is does your fear keep you from a radical relationship with god does it keep you from a p relationship with god more than just going to church on sunday going to a midweek service o even going to bible talks or group discussions or oneonone study does your fear keep you from that r personal relationship with god xx does your fear keep you from deep p relationships with one another you know the world is an interesting place we all cr that dont we as human beings a personal relationship were looking for personal relationships were looking for friendship arent we you know c uh craig was uh uh greg was i always get those two mixed up greg and craig you look so much arike like yeah greg was sharing something with me that last sunday when we were in the middle of the snow storm he decided and the g and and the and the brothers in that apartment they were gonna go out and knock on all the doors in their apartment invite people to come to the worship service cause no one could get out they were all snowed in so he went around the building knocking on doors which f in itself is crazy right yeah it is its crazy i mean you know how many times have you done that in your life m_its crazy its out of the out of the ordinary maybe a little bit insane but anyway they went around knocking on doors inviting people to come down he said it was amazing i could hear people there but they wouldnt come to the door and then there were others he knocked on the people would come to the door they would talk but they wouldnt open the door then there were others who opened the door just a little bit just t to see who was there you know or you look out that peep hole let me just see the holes about this big and you stick your you know youre looking like this right oh lord and then there were others who opened their door and went to the service and it changed their lives amen but fear keeps us from those personal relationships with one another were so concerned about what everybody else th yep about us thats right doesnt that cripple you yeah whats someone gonna think if they find out im a christian what is someone gonna think when i tell em im a disciple that i dont do these things anymore jeez what are they gonna think if i inv them to learn about jesus and to study the bible see were so concerned were afraid were f and that f robs us of that d personal relationship with god and that deep personal relationship with one another we all experience it it keeps us f keeps us from changing our lives preach it walter fear keeps us from changing the world needed to overcome their fears in order that they might have that radical relationship with god the disciples needed to overcome their fears in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another the disciples needed to overcome their fears in order to change their li the disciples needed to overcome their fears in order to change the world thats right and if we go back and we examine the gospels amen we see very clearly that all the time that jesus spent with them they were afraid peter was afraid thomas was afraid they were many many times afraid but they uh they understood the only way they would overcome their f would be through jesus christ and his example because the lor had many challenging times in his life where fair where fear could be the dominant f that could take away his relationship with god amen i mean think about it you know i was uh thinking about fear and i guess that what prompted me about this is cause im fearful person you say oh well youre getting up here and speak in front of two or three hundred people and you know youve done this and youve done that and youve done this and im like well yeah amen but im still a fearful person but i really wanna overcome my fears i wanna get a d and deeper with the lor i wanna get deeper and deeper with you i wanna get d i wanna b able to change my life and i wanna be able to change the world you know ive had the opportunity to r to to just really go back and read some things outside of the bible uh on martin luther king junior cause the guy blows my mind he blows my heres a man who die for what he believed he die to see j equality peace he died for that and im thinking he is willing to drink that cup he was afraid many times but he p through his fears in order to succeed and have v for himself and for the people that were around him the black nation of america you know we need to lear number one if we are gonna overcome our fears the first point is to f our fears in order to overcome our fears we must f our fears amen thats right i w a i had the opportunity as you know to spend a lot of time with my brother hes moved in with us and just to talk and and as we were talking what came ou is really his fears what he was afraid of in becoming a disciple in becoming a christian and it brought me back to the time when i was studying the bible and i remember all of the fears that were in m life in c in in making a decision to follow christ you know i can remember the fear of they all wanna take my money that was a fear for me that was real i worked hard for my money i was concerned about this cultic organization trying to take my money you know id look at the checkbook my wife would write a check for ten dollars id go crazy cause i was afraid they would take my money right paul yeah sure i was afraid i was gonna lose my personality as you can see ive not lost it amen amen its been matured yeah thats yeah amen i was afraid i was gonna lose my identity well as you can see xxx still got one amen maybe it needs to change some but i still have it i was afraid that id be robbed of my individuality id be robbed of my independence and my free will well let me tell you im plenty independent uhoh and i have f a free will to choose and pick what i want to do with my life but what ive cho is to overcome my fea and give my life to jesus christ amen but we must f our fears a yourselves why are you afraid think about your own fears think about your own personal fears inside your life the deep ones not the outside ones about money and stuff but the deep deep truths in your heart cause each one of us have some things in our life that were very fearful about ask yourself why am i afraid see we need to ask ourselves that question every single day we need to ask ourselves that question every single time it comes up because in that way confronting our fears it will give us a m of success it will give us a measure of power it doesnt mean weve done it yet but when we bring it up it will give us a measure of that power it will give us a measure of success not the total victory but a small measure to understand where were really at yeah amen you know the thing about fears the more we attempt to ignore or repress them the more we m the conflict inside wow thats right isnt that true you know when youre afraid to deal with something and youre afr and then all of a sudden it starts multiplying and now youre really afraid right and now you dont want to say anything to any about anything right cause its started to multiply and the longer that fear goes the more it multiplies till it gets to the point where it totally immobilizes you right till you become to unable to move you become stymied mm still and we know as human beings just like nature if were not growing were dying and that fear starts to eat away at you you know the great thing about bringing your fears up too is that when you bring your fears up what we find out many times is that theyre more imaginary than they are real yes isnt that true its like i need to talk to windham about this its like oh i dont know if i wanna talk to windham about this and then i start then this fear start to multiply you know what i mean yeah then i dont wanna talk right then u then i go and talk oh hes gonna say this and hes gonna say that and hes gonna be in my face and danadanadanadana and im like and then i go and i talk to him i muster up which is m our second point which is courage amen i muster up the courage and i talk to windham and you know what im like wow that isnt anything like i thought isnt that true and i feel so much better im like i cant believe i did that what a dummy what a fool that i would think those things see because a lot of times our fear really are imaginary see fea really involves the misuse of our imagination yeah thats right mm you know when youre talking about being a disciple and you hear these incredibly har sermons and i do preach a few hard sermons amen todays not one of those real hard ones no i thought id give you a break thanks bro maybe i needed a break ive had a few this week but really its true i mean we we and you hear these incredibly hard sermons well what do they mean about this and what do they mean about that oh ho ha oh ha i mean i do that i used to hear kip preach in the opera house woohoo and id be like oh who is this ma oh i cant believe he said that and id go there even before we even got there id be sharing wed go wed be with laurie and id invite someone to come to church with me and they would come and id say boy i hope he doesnt preach this and i hope he doesnt preach that and i hope he doesnt say this and i hope he doesnt say that you ever felt that way see and we all of a sudden the fear starts you know what i mean and it totally our imagination runs wil see um fear is really the misuse of our imagination to focus on the negative wow as opposed to the positive you could use that imagination in a great positive way to give you courage and thats really my second point to overcome fear we really need to be able to have courage look it at first john chapter four actually i do i dont wanna leave this first point till i make this this point within the point uh you know its it was really pretty straightforward this morning and y z i thought you did a good job all the way through i mean you were on top of what you were scanning hm thanks um shouldve kept that one horizon fauker jet just t keep em on the right why did you switch em well uh looking at something i would get it didnt seem like i could get someone else out but um a part of it to provide a good service but then yeah uh well uh that that i guess thats one reason the two eights kind of well two eights kinda nice sometimes because uh uh i mean when were on ten all the departures seemed like theyre going out the left so you really want your arrivals on the right when youre landing two eight then you can get departures off of almost both at any time so you always got a hole n_yeah yeah so but uh dont feel bad about keeping horizon on the right boy because mhm sure doesnt hurt them to taxi any theyre so used to having a number one service yeah plus when theyre departing every one of em came theyre right by the gate everyone even even one or one or two of em i said ill advise if the left becomes available and they said w and they they still ask wed like the left if it becomes available i know they still ask and viking is the same way yeah so theres sh theres sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though um traffic watch eight we discussed so radar service ter um call me inbound or you wanna say radar service terminated frequency change approved report back inbound or i i think that something a little little more like thats better than just saying radar service terminated because hes kinda left hanging okay and you could just say radar service terminated report back inbound and then hell hell either come back and say well im departing the area now back to hillsborrow or ill call you back inbound so that gives you an idea okay but uh a uh uh along with that let tc do more of the work for you okay you know um just tell her what you want her to do i was thinking of a couple instances where you couldve used her more than you did okay i was thinking that for my rundowns you know that would uh thats that would have been a help but on the other s the other hand i wanna get it on tape heck of a job lance oh thank you very much did you hear that um the problem with doing rundowns is that its kind of over in your face yeah yeah so cause the dlights kind of pretty far over to the left there but sh you can you can have her do it if you want um i would im just working at doing as much of these other things as i possibly can because theyll be times when i wont have a tc and just just challenging myself and thats okay um what were some of the things other than what what were some of the things that that i should have used her for that i didnt depending on who your who your tc is if c certain people sit down there they d they have a tendency to do everything for you and sometimes that is p that is really pretty nice if you just if you just all you have to do is stand up and look out the window and look at the bright and talk uh you no other w no other coordination or or arts functions or anything that really is nice thats ideal it it really helps mhm the situation mhm so but uh right now like you say maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff um i dont think there was i mean i had just a couple that i switched to the left you know maybe three or so that i switched to the left uh p uh probably two or three and so there was that i didnt have any arts entries i had you know traffic watch to slue out to um yeah for the most part i mean i was able to k i think i was able to keep up with that stuff with the arts yeah i mean there wasnt really nothing much to do um no there wasnt so but there could be yeah if theres vfrs departing or yeah i told her to do my vfr guys oh yeah and um to write down my vfrs thats one thing i gotta kick myself to do yeah now are we still required to w write like the empires that coming in through the gates vfr dont they we are any vfr now isnt that arent they when they c but what if theyve c well i guess we have no way of knowing if theyve come in ifr and then cancelled vfr well yeah because they have a strip on it down mhm so i dont uh actually uh im like you i dont really know what the point is of that because we do have a record of em anyway but mhm uh when the when the order came across or whatever or this memorandum that said to write down all vfr arrivals okay so if theyre a vfr arrival youre supposed to write it down okay ill do that then unhunh when horizon onethirtyeight didnt answer you there go back to ground yeah or just move on to something else i mean you tried him a couple times you say horizon onethirtyeight xxxxx if they dont get the hint if hes but if you cant get him just go on and do something else that you can do united was calling ready to go yeah so shoot just let united go hori yeah you cant do nothing with him so just have him hold there so just go on to the next okay next thing and do tell ground he might be still on ground frequency which is uh usually not too likely because you know at that point at that point well hes out there you know hes and hes probably sitting there and th hes not hearing anything from the tower you know yeah hes probably looking at his radio about then yeah i think i was a little bit rigid in my planning of that cause i wanted to had to plan to get him out at that point a i shouldve been more flexible and but uh you know everything else i saw you your separation was was really good this morning i mean you really tightened em up maybe a couple times almost a l bit too tigh a little too tight cause uh uh i dont know y a couple times you had like one just barely at departure end a jet at departure and you cleared another jet for takeoff and it worked out great oh one guy out the right and then oh th both guys out the left both guys out to the left and it worked out good but uh i think it worked out because this guy was real slow on on starting his departure roll you know mhm usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end before you clear the next guy and watch out for the uh the seventh four fourhundreds okay or three hundreds and okay because uh uh theyll really climb and they can go fast too okay so well you know just take into consideration the type of aircrafts it takes the seventwentyseven a little b while to get wound up while the seventhirtysevenll really go but uh uh i mean it was really good good departure separation thanks i was impressed a you saw a little bit about the twosixty heading uh listen to the readbacks for yeah if i know hes at twothirty but you can wrap em around to onethirty or onesixty to avoid the mba and that works great because otherwise you got twosixty there was that one time you had two south plan aircraft and one westbound or river metro and mhm mhm i d i actually didnt think you were gonna have three miles between the two first mhm south plan air lane but you did that was perfect the one that i kept on runway heading for a bit yeah or yeah okay and that was good it was real good planning to keep that one caravan on runway heading when you had the other one going twosixty to ensure that you had oh and you had the one going twoforty or some and then you had the metro going s going twosixty yeah but you kept the metro on this runway heading which is really good planning so im im less and less impacted for lack of a better word by these g for some reason with all these um i think the bulk of my planning seems to revolve around these little guys when i can turn em fitting em in with all my other guys for some reason i mean y and that is you know those guys having a very fec affective part in the whole fan of all our departures and um hm i think theyre theyre a affecting me less than they did in the past yeah does that make sense yeah do you know what i mean um cause i there was a time where i mean that sequence was good too but there was a time when yeah an i it it may happen again yeah who knows where ive got the little west coasts in here and all these guys off the right and left where am i actually gonna fit these guys in and theyre all calling theyre ready way early and well the sequence uh cant be too bad when you got when you can feed from charley xx and from bravo and from alpha you know uh the sequence cant be too bad i mean all he did you got some you can do yeah all he did is send em all out i mean you got all the west coasts in the row over on charley you got the jets in a row on bravo and you got n various things over here so you can pick and choose you know y i mean as a ground control you can just send em all out there and then when they get there then you can start arranging the strips you know the way you want almost yeah you know th thats yeah that it works great that way because you dont have to sequence em at some other point in their taxi route you know yeah theyre b they e essentially on their own taxiway up through up to the approach end so so that was about all that i you know that i had i mean i was paying pretty close attention there and i didnt really see much of a problem oh thanks n significant problems xx to talk about im glad see there was s oh um dont always uh um dont insist on always saying seven hundred if you say oh why hadnt you at some point after he is leaving seven just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean some you can do that yeah yeah there was a couple times you didnt need to say it when when you did it was out in the yeah yeah well i mean y w couldve either waited just a bit it was at he was at a five climb and or he was a just go ahead and say turn left heading one six zero okay or turn left heading two six zero for a metro i mean if you leave em on runway heading for a little bit mhm theyre gonna be at the altitude you need so but thats no big deal a uh i was watching jet speed come in and you got delta out in front of jet speed mhm it seemed like you were a little tense with that but really pay attention to the speeds when theyre coming in he was doing a hundred and twenty outside of laker there did you see that yeah yeah so that that worked out great i wondered if youd saw yeah i mean there was lots of room lots of time mhm he wasnt he z wasnt flying as a normal mhm for some reason he just used the mhm or is it uh exec jet one of those guys is usually really fast jet speed is th i know fast on the pr departure amflight it seems yeah uh i think it seems like that was the one but yeah amflight when they fly the later jet um yeah and i think i might have said for delta niners or to no delay or some like that and yeah i think you did and he was actually floating at uh the jet speed wasnt yeah yeah you had a lot of time yeah when the twins get airborne you got a jet following the twin twins gonna go southwestbound if you got sixthousand feet and the twins climbing out of four or five hundred you can start your transmission then to the to the jet okay twin cesna ahead is will be turning southwestbound momentarily runway two eight left clear for takeoff it says in sight just didnt wanna be sure he gets his turn in mhm okay the caravans coming across if you wanna get yeah what do you say cause ive heard different phraseology and i af feel like i was stumbling over that i think i said it couple different ways a mile west or something ill i just say uh you know on a day like this its so easy to see em i would just say the caravan ahead is southwestbound runway two eight left clear for takeoff and and theyll a lot of times theyll say uh in sight if they dont say in sight theyll say uh theyll i would assume they have em in sight because they wont go mhm unless they seem em i mean thats important to them to see the traffic but its safe its a safe operation because uh one thing you could do is is turn the caravan to twoforty mhm to get him across and then just before you ship em send em back to twofifty xx something like that hm cause the tracks what im whats important but but twofifty was working out fine today fifteen degrees and a mile is what you need so or less using visual yeah in fact it was a was the west coast that was it the horizon who said he could do the visual with the twin cesna ahead or was it vice versa one of the two yeah and at that point i said dont need it now they got it somebody in there i think laura went in there yeah comm line for you xxx have a call on the other line this is randy okay m_bye another thing i thought was interesting was the this uh the emphasis on transportation do you remember the automobile this was the be o the uh change mhm xxxxx x uh train a uh car auto unhunh and uh hm i think margaret though mhm i uh i dont think we can underestimate her i mean i think shes a like a lot of women that i have known i mean shes in control there is no doubt i mean henry wilcox may think hes in control but he is hm and there would never be a jacky bast while she is uh the head of of that h household whereas i thought missis wilc the first missis wilcox ruth mhm was so other worldly and everything else mhm she didnt even have a clue as to what was going on mhm so i felt that that uh margaret is is and i thought for this time she was tremendously uh just in charge shes very practical yeah mh and she didnt care the to b to she didnt care about emancipation mhm i mean m she wa mhm so she when you really are already that way you dont have to make a big todo about it mhm mhm mhm but she also i thought al in the movie she had a very strong personality a lot of charisma mhm and very positive did you see the movie diane hmm which is also what youre saying but mhm but she just radiated something which was personality mhm you know a funny there are two young people that i have talked to about the movie and i havent seen it but one of them uh was my niece and i said something about margaret talking about her feeling that she was the i think i used the word heroine and she said heroine and she couldnt see margaret as a heroine i think margaret xx and then she went on to explain she said maybe she was too stro uh were used to seeing someone as the uh you know the protagonist or the the woman on the screen as a romantic as uh all of that and i i havent seen the movie but that was her feeling about it hm hunh had she read the book also you no no t just the no because xx goes to movies okay and an be because the other thing about margaret that would be uh a heroine is that she marries henry even though all this has happened a then she she sticks with henry mhm even though all you know mhm the son ends up killing you know all this happens and she sticks it out with henry yeah and tha maybe young people nowadays wouldnt have done xx they wouldnt have thought that heroic they would have thought that marching out and saying i wont stay you know or mhm i wont marry you or whatever mm i i wanted to know excuse me i wanted to know what you thought about why she agreed to marry him to begin with because although i understand the reasons that are given in the book i still couldnt quite decide that thats something she would have decided to do uh but i n i know what you mean the only thing i was thinking maybe she was older her chances were you know it was changing mm and uh because she was very pleased when he asked her ha and she admired him according to the b mm well i dont think henry was the horrible person that but uh a lot of critics felt that he was i think m forster wanted him to be that way and i just didnt look at it that way mhm when i read about him but i thought he had a lot of good qualities did you see some char there mhm hm okay mhm hm this is for the movie she evidently di uhuh mhm well the book she kept saying he was charming mhm well i read the book too i mean he and i he r he uh she described him as a charming mhm when she was talking about him to some helen or th in her thoughts or something margaret said you know he i mean mister wilcox is a charming man hm yeah hm well as long as things are going his way i guess i couldnt see any charm either place an and i i guess thats what kept kinda s bringing me up short on believing this marriage after all or and the times too linda you know nineteen ten mhm there wasnt a great deal of opportunity for a uh i was gonna say didnt she think she really had to be married i dont know but she well the i dont know the thing i didnt under is i dont know why both families were so against paul and helen and then the rest of em x and yen then hen henry and margaret got married and there didnt seem to be any dissension there well the her you know his kids didnt like tha no his kids didnt like it but henry was a bu but the well pau had no future but the yeah but that was y_he had no money paul hadnt made his money um or anything and uh yeah i thought it was mainly because of the difference in the families though that they perhaps i misunderstood that i dont know i i dont know that either i uh i agree more with linda that that i think it was a situa where paul couldnt marry anybody because he had to go uh overseas he didnt have any money a make his f you know make his way in the world cause he couldnt support a woman mhm and and maybe those families see rather than the basts who would get married whether they could support somebody or not they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money or or a certain future in order to end up position yeah position in order to have a wife ready to go mm did helen not have enough money to support them i wonder why couldnt helen have just supported them well i think that that was that wasnt they they wouldnt have allowed that thats not a the wilcoxes wouldnt have that wouldnt have been alright look at missis wilcox xx according to the wilcoxes the the the their code of honor remember the uh yeah strong english honor that they uh that charles had to de men would take care of them you know right except in out of africa when uh margaret uh when margaret married uh mister wilcox which is about the same time mhm mhm what uh did uh it seems to me xx in the movie they were looking at this b house in of this big house did they move to a big house where did they live i think they lived in the big house they did live in the big house they ended up living in howards end for a while didnt they no yeahl at the end they were in howards end who was at howards end at the end i thought it was helen and the little boy no all of em were at howards end i thought all of em xxxx they all lived in how end henry margaret buffalo helen they were all one big happy family whole family oh my god w when uh that was kind of unbelievable wasnt it tell me an one and margaret brought em all together well and when they married and the other thing and when uh they married did uh uh what was his name the uh wimpy little son tibby the bro tibby did tib and the young girl come and live with them tibby i dont know what happened to tibby t was i dont remember from the book well tibby wasnt there when when he they at the wedding see is when helen uh conceived and so then shortly thereafter she me went away she went to like ger germany or some place like that and she stayed in germany o oh un friend of t but that wasnt margarets wedding that was evies wedding that was be they got married okay yeah thats right that was before margaret even got married right so by the time margaret gets married maybe they didnt live there the whole time helens preg an shes away some tibby was gone be she is yeah shes hiding i see essentially isnt it also basically a womans the women are m more developed characters than the men and the men tend to be mhm not such good people yeah i think so isnt that in weak an that he would write that way if he was a homosexual ex he was raised by his mother i dont know that everybody agrees with that and but aunt and so on yeah so the the mo pardon the mothers have always been uh women figures in his life were so strong obviously mhm uh bu but but the fellow isnt that what youre saying tibby is was isnt that is name he but he was such a wimpy mhm sure phy weak uh person uh they all had asthma i wouldnt know who they always hm and uh and paul wasnt even living on the farm they all had uh hm even charles wasnt diane what was it hay fever or asth or something xxxxx yes diane started to say something about out of africa yes well youre talking about the woman having the money and why th m a man couldnt mhm mhm marry her marry the mhm y yeah in uh out of africa i think is about this same time period or may well maybe its s second world war but isak dine later the heroine of out of africa is danish but shes the one with money and she ends up a the brother of the person that shes in love with marries her yeah yeah because he has no money no family money but she has money and she has no way to get a husband so they agree to get married because he will then have access to her money and title and shell have a husband so it was done my point of all that was that it was sometimes done that a woman of means married a man of no means as uh an arrangement for what ever reason yeah i and so it could have been that this i guess that her money could have been the s source of marriage if theyd wanted it to be thats to me uh uh kind of a m n taken care o very well in the book i i guess i dont know why they didnt yeah why that was such a no no and i didnt realize forster grew up with money that sort of mixed me all up now too because mhm it sounded to me like he hadnt and mhm yeah i have a question about england in nineteen ten too which sh that my lack of history was england the strong world power in nineteen ten still the w empire english the sun never sets on the english empire tha that was where uh mhm a a wilcox made his money wasnt it in s what was it some kind of trade in uh i g ive forgotten what it was hm uh was it he had i think he had rubber tr plantations rubber plantations xxxx yeah cause i read passage to india xxxxxx a hundred years ago in college and that was all about the colony of india mhm and eng colonial things mhm so i thought england was in a position of great strength in nineteen ten i think it was hm i think it probably was xxx i think it was xx but it was getting ready to but the winds of change move away thats right were beginning to blow had begun to blow mhm wonder who was the ruler in nineteen ten who was the king or queen m i dont know hmm when what was victorias reign well thats what im trying to think of about well close to that w uh remember they uh well when did edward give up upstairs downstairs i should think it would have been george the fifth xxx the uh mhm mm uh mhm what was it uh the her son came i in about nineteen ten yeah x vic son was that edward the one that yeah the ward in a england the one who was a such a well he was weak wasnt he mhm the one that abdi yeah no that was later no that was later mhm well at the beginning of world war o in the guns of august it was nineteen eighteen they four a of the crowned heads was that was the last time they were a together so it had already was well over the horizon into setting mhm by nine fourteen a mhm so nineteen ten it just so in nine ten mhm there would de have been un the wi of cha beginning to mhm okay mhm but england really didnt start losing her colonies did she until more like second world war thats when they div divest well maybe mhm mhm was af r second world war mhm okay mhm may the power over them was becoming weak xxx mhm i uh by this time wasnt that part of the problem they had cause they were trying to hold the colonies together and then they also had to deal with the war in europe i thought so i mean was that the prob m that they had to be was that world war two or world war one i dont know i dont know but i think that was part of the problem because they couldnt be more world war two xxx was it two deb i think yeah i think more more was world war two well they were transferring the power in india werent they to be in the thirties uh more like world war two m i mean ne when gandhi so the thir and forties maybe was yeah m time of gandhi and all of that m un unhunh mhm it was kind of interesting to read these uh hm critical reviews i got this out of the book review digest since it was written in nineteen ten reviews were writ in nineteen ten hm hunh heres one when was the book written nine ten nineteen ten it was published yeah published in nineteen ten um mister forster this is from the new york times in nineteen february nineteen eleven mister forster seems to write conventional comedy for that his sense of character values is entirely adequate whi there his blith blithe manner and journalistic uh wittiness of phrase serves him well but he invinces neither power nor inclination to come to grips with any vital human problem which totally dis disagrees with everything weve been saying this afternoon but what a different wording of a review too its so proper ye mm yeah true an stilted unhunh and yeah true x saturday re said whether one likes it or not x howards end is a rea novel xxx that was in nineteen ten and something that uh it was ab capital spec i dont know what it was but if his defects are exasperating his qualities are remarkable vivid characterization a happy command of dialog and a f and a f humor the clash of modern culture hm and modern materialism has seldom found a more vivid interpreter oh ive never seen that does the library have these magazines on microfilm oh my clear back to nineteen ten well this is from the book review digest so they have all of these little reviews ah oh i didnt know they had that at on this one page uhuh that theyve collected that early oh of oh my of his book i didnt havent seen that but janice you did an awful lot of research on it cause i took that uh i mean those reviews yeah that was wonderful yeah yeah well i didnt spend too much time putting it together but yeah but moder xxxxxxxx modern culture and modern materialism i mean thats essentially what were saying thats what weve been saying thats right cultu mhm and materi thats right thats right so so they that was even there they hit it on the head uh thats right m the the humor were having a little trouble with though thats right yeah i xx the humor well although it was xx there were there were times when it w it wa under underlying humor a little bit mhm you know english humor the the like like the t in the movie at least that when the ba come to the to the wedding reception a and oh yes jacky sits down there and starts shoveling in the food and drinking the drinks and its really its funny until then they have the confron with henry right and then it isnt funny anymore right mm but it is kind of humorous well i uh i was gonna tell you of the one oth the other uh young person that i talked to about the book was a former student who is now a psychiatrist who lives in california we were talking about the book or about the movie he hadnt read the book he said it was a good movie but not a great movie and he said it was without passion oh my hm hm so now oh good heavens what do you make of that i dont know w m i think thats typical of english movies he definitely wouldnt like michael xx well thats uh uh yeah i i really do i thought uhuh i thought and i think i said well maybe it was because it was english they are unhunh its all kind of uh i dont know how you can say its without passion xx i didnt think so ei i mean but i didnt argue well the passion of leonard bast and and helen and then the passion of charles and the confron with leonard mhm no but thats tragedy thats not necessarily passion the well what uh no but it was xx xxx what are we talking about passion well i think it lets define passion well xxxx i think how we define it xxx passion means to xx yeah passion mhm i think probably he meant well trong feeling yeah not sex yeah mhm but more strong feeling mhm look at margarets uh well certainly there wasnt passion between henry and margaret yeah there was no oh yes there was no but strong feel but strong well strong feeling strong feeling i mean it isnt but not pas i dont think theres strong feelings in this book that much uh only for howards end ruth had uh ruth had strong feelings for howards end and it didnt do her one bit of good because it her bequest was ignored and the rest of the people are just kind of floating along oh no no no no no see i dont get that helen has tremendous passion about her beliefs margarets speech to henry well about her beliefs but they dont make one bit of difference in the whole world margarets speech to henry is one of the most passionate things i have ever read well i found that part xx i thought she mowed him down didnt she i thought it was beautiful mhm and later it says she thought back over that and she wouldnt have changed a word of it absolutely oh i think there was a lot of feeling a lo of feeling was this novel popular when it was published uh according to the professor that it is a classic of change it is w uh one of the uh classic novels that has to do with change but did the people like it tradition and change when they read it back then i would imagine that he was popular with xxx well is it being revi now i think he was popular or seems to be well in the introduction it said i dont know that in the forties they are doing that with so many of those now when they w you had uh fitz uh gerald and uh hemingway and other wellknown writers uh hemingway and faulkner and and yet this guy was still up there in the forties and this book was written in nineteen ten i didnt care for it i well you know what turned me off the the hi the big description about the dumb old umbrella and did the umbrella have uh a smoo end on it or did it have a knobby end and i thought for crying out why am i sitting wasting my time reading about umbrella hands and then helen says and and the description of the music oh we gr we steal umbrellas all the time and x xxx xxx we steal em all the time that was part of the humor theres got to be something better to read hunh now that was supposed to be part of the i did i did not enjoy was that supposed to be humor i i thats eng hu did you enjoy it somewhat mhm or at least helen a margarets humor i did not enjoy reading the book x above average that was their humor mhm i just couldnt xxxx but i enjoyed the movie couldnt quite get into it yeah i think that helped me appreciate the book well evelyn helped me stay with the book because she said it was written in a different time and of course its british and so because i was having trouble getting started i got hung up and it doesnt make any difference but uh when you were reading the review you talked about the affair between helen and paul did i get the right names and i thought all that happened was was a kiss he he kissed her and and they had i thought so too i thought so too and they had this and they had this understanding of the souls oh ye that they were in love yeah i think thats true and and im thinking what is the big deal about this this aunt is coming down here everybodys getting in an uproar because somebody thought they liked somebody i you know i got lost in that and i talked to evelyn and she said now y just stay with it its written in a different time and i thought okay a different time yes maybe that is important you know come on well lori did you see the movie so no im going to rent it after i leave here today see i think i think its better to see the movie first i am too lori and then read the book i think itll help i think it i think well and its getting a little f m its a good way to do it you know im getting more into the characters well m one time in this group and i think it was i dont remember if it was evelyn or deborah but it was probably it was one of those people who are so knowledge it wasnt was oh certainly wasnt any of us might have been nora come on tell me about it he he talked uh they talked about what makes a classic oh and they had several criteria oh and ive for some of them oh but the ones i can think of is that it has to be able to be read on many levels yeah and i think that this is one of those books this one does that you can read as just a story about these people who are wanting to to live at this howards end or you can read it as the clash between the intellectual and the practical or between england and germany which is really what theyre getting down to was the basis of that mhm mhm that was something mhm it can be read at any time it can ap to england in nineteen ten or it can apply to america in nineteen ninetythree with how far are we going to go with entitlements how much are we going to take from the uh so called really wealthy whos the only people thats going to be touched by this budget yeah how nice and all of these things and give to these poor you forg i mean even the you forgot the corporate income tax which is going up and up and up and up and up and if somebody says entitlements one more time im gonna s okay i wont say that why are these en i wont say that why are you entitled to this the corporate income tax is going to be raised one percent and so therefore the g big corporations in the u_s are backing this budget change in washington well at any rate i think theres that is as as typical today i mean as topical today as it was then and then it has to deal with the big questions uh the of moral values and of w how you uh per the world mhm and all of this with it and i there were some others and i cant even remember what they all were but i i know but it was evelyn who did it and we ought to make her get her notes out again because sh yes if you can find this she probably re uh ev i dont remember will you do that a some oh i will remember i just i just cant remember what it was but i thought there were five and ive only come up with four hm i thought she had five oh i only heard three what was the lets the well the eternal truths at any time on any level oh eternal truths yeah i missed the eternal truth at any time on any level and by any age m uh well you didnt mention one thing i thought it was very interesting and i thought you all w i who are m would have picked up on it the relation betwee a man and a woman i thought there was one phrase in there the crystal what was it the crystal uh shield that comes down after a couple is married oh and i have realized that xxx so many times with friends hm with whom i was very very intimate you know and yet when they are married hm there is a conjugal mhm oneness that is uh something that i was never able to penetrate stoods m m mhm hm and i thought that was an interesting phrase mhm i also thought it was very interesting her relation with her husband mhm why she married him i dont know but she was able to see the good in any as well as the bad mhm hm and to live with it and con to yeah sort of push at the ba you know um and try to improve him she kept see mhm maybe its because she did it with open eyes mhm yeah in the movie you see her looking out her window across the street into the wilsons apartment and they seem to be a happy very happy congenial family they seem to have a lot of interaction going on in that family mhm i dont know its maybe there was something thats true by the fact that she she saw uh a happy family they talked and communicated and laughed and had a good association with each other as she peeked out her window looking at this uh family thats a good point well and i think yeah but i think so ruth miss the first missis wilcox thought highly of her husband and margaret thought highly of her mhm and do you remember when she was going to go down to howards end with her mhm and all of a sudden he appeared he came back mhm and missis wilcox said well im so glad to see you and she walked away with her husband hm m well i think janice is right that he was charming and im forget i think we forget that we all have that innate need to have a partner i mean well and and a provider too yeah you know m yeah he took care of every i mean we all we all envy that oneness mhm mhm m mhm and when you dont have it you really envy it m m so i mean thats a r a stro drawing point we look over a lot of things i mean none of us would be married if we were married perfect partners m definite m yeah yeah uh or if they were looking for perfect hm in us mhm mhm well we are h we are all human i thought that was the b the thing about margaret that i could uh see ten minutes well uh thats what i considered spiritual vision mhm m that she could see the human qual yeah maybe thats one thing about the book uh what what evelyn what uh lois said was that you know it translates to everybody nobodys husband is per mhm mhm y n or no and nobody is perfect x or no person mhm mhm mhm no

win the next hand quit you suck yeah hmm youre so happy with your no im just happy that i beat you oh yeah yeah the big stuff hunh yeah the big stuffs all my stanford stuff oh now what backgammon whats hearts hearts its the card game oh yeah put it up there wan play hearts lets check that one out y_neat wait play novice ive never played hearts be youve never played hearts in my life no i dont know how to play it oh okay ill teach you passing disabled thats you queen of sp uh first lead rotates first yeah always pass left alright so this is us groucho harpo uh the object okay every heart okay every heart is one point is tr the q queen of spades is thirteen points the object is not to have any points and you p following suit an you can take if you take tricks th the highest card of the suit takes the trick if you dont have the card of the suit you throw whatever you want okay so h hearts and the queen of spades are bad are the only thing that are that that have points that are points right so if you so if you throw uh look okay y so we got like three points right here right we have three points in our hand exactly and we w wanna try to get rid of that n_right but were pa now the first thing you do is you pa three cards to your left now these are low hearts so i can im not gonna pass those im gonna pass the f four of clubs all the y right why is that and these are two high why just because and cause you should always pass a club so that the person so that the first hand y everyone has a club so that they cant discard a heart cause you always assume that everyones t no one is voi of a suit the first time around so you dont have to worry about throwing a high card yeah yeah and then im gonna throw two high cards so i dont take those tricks because but what difference does it make if you take a trick well because i theyre not worth anything cause if i t if i take a tr the k diamond trick and somebody didnt have diamonds and they threw a heart into that pile i was gonna take that with that ace so if i throw an ace of diamonds and somebody doesnt have any diamonds theyre gonna throw a heart on me and im gonna have to take that trick okay but but if they play hearts that doesnt that doesnt win anything i if they play h n_okay just go ahead and play okay alright so im passing three s_three cards and i got the seven of hearts three of hearts and the king of f spades begin play the two of clubs always leads uh im gonna throw the ace of clubs assuming im gonna take this trick okay okay no one have to and then and everybody right so its kinda risky playing the king since but im gonna assume everyone has clubs still okay alright xxx okay cause there are thirteen cards im assuming its an equal deal now there are eight clubs out that means there are only f more left so you dont y so you wanna play so im gonna a high d high diamond yeah exactly like a high diamond so jack of diamonds okay taken with okay so he took that okay now the spade so now now this is a tricky one now if i have a high spade now id throw it because i could take this trick and the h my highest spade would be out now i dont ever wanna take the queen of spades high spades are dangerous because you might queen of spades is a hard cr card to get rid of so if yeah okay i see now i dont have oh i do have a spade well youre in a good position now because youve seen what everybody else has played right thats why diamond so you have to play a diamond now h right right and there have been no diamond has there been a diamond trick theres been one diamond trick uh y yeah w only one though yeah right yeah okay yeah you played your ace okay now it was le the spade was led but theres a heart in this trick so i wanna get under the seven because i dont wanna take this trick because theres a heart okay but thats easy cause i only have two spades and theyre both under seven uh so you would have taken that if i had a eight so now you can still get under that i could still get under so alright too hes got an eight so you now li okay now b two different people took hearts now if you t have all if you take all the points if you take all the points all thirteen hearts and the queen of diamonds so thats twentysix points its called right its called shooting the moon and you get you give everyone else twentysix points or else youre minus twentysix points and thats good shooting the moon is really hard to do now look it i dont have a club so you can throw a heart there you go a high heart okay i dont have a club now somebody else did take hearts right or did he or am i mistaken i thought ev someone else did take hearts i think somebody else did take hearts queen of spades gonna have to come up m n there there it is he led did he just shoot the moon i thought someone else took no ch yeah so he got groucho got one heart one and chico got twentyfive so hes b kinda bumming right now so he sucks right okay so pass three cards so we wanna pa uh alright pa so were gonna pass the king of spades king of puppydogs feet how come you dont pass the king of clubs i might i dont have any aces here im gonna pass a low heart just so they cant shoot the moon i got the ace of hearts okay two of clubs king of clubs ace is out so my queen is the highest there alright my jack is the highest there so you wanna play that now oh well ill do it so you took that one yeah but that doesnt make any difference uh right now the two see alright now diamonds are a wasted alright did you just take that no that heart no no groucho has the uh spades were led the f so you play spa was led the ace take can you play a club if spades were led and you didnt have i can yeah i can but but if you had hearts yeah so you can play anything then i can lead i can pl th i can play anything so why dont you just get rid of high clubs right im thinking im gonna know whos g harpos gonna take this so the points are split now so i dont have to worry now the queen is the highest so uh two l the two of hearts is a great lead you cant lead hearts unless hearts have already been dropped also yeah oh shit oh fuck i took a point there im gonna take all the rest i think um how can you maybe not oh man i knew it im gonna take all the rest fuck i just got like seven points shit eight x alright i have no spades this is a really good hand i have no spades whatsoever its really good play hear im gonna try to shoot the moon so erasmus laid the the laid the egg which luther hatched and um when you come then to uh however this debate this freedom of the will um i think uh let me read you a page from brendler because it sets the sa stage very nicely this is in the luther book some of you are reading and um if you this evening when you go home if you wanna meditate it on more on on it more its on page three eleven its on page three eleven but let me just read you the cause this gives us the setting very nicely and then we can uh erasmus entitled his antiluther pamphlet diatribe concerning free will once again the first and fundamental questions disputed in fifteen sixteen and fifteen seventeen and again in heidelberg in april of fifteen eighteen with which luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology were debated luther was glad to take up the the of this debate and this is what luther writes to erasmus you alo among all the others have recogni the key question and you do not bore me with the papacy purgatory indulgences and similar nonsense you and you alone have identifie that on which a else hinges and you have put the razor to the throat and for that i thank you heartily u thus luther evalu uh evaluated the subject and erasmus commented on the significance of their engagement in battle in his own style and he wrote to luther perhaps an erasmus who writes against you will do more for the gospel than certain dunderheads who support you and then humanistic thinking will never consent this is brendler now obs uh on this uh but this sets the stage for what were gonna talk about humanistic thinking will never conse to the doctrine of original sin pico de la mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin the author of uh what is it houseman i think of invictus i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul i dont think that he would acknowledge original sin is based uh alright what is it its based as it is on the concept that human nature is totally depraved and of itself not capable of any good will and that apart from grace alone free will is nothing can do nothing does nothing except depraved deeds even though these pronouncements are biblically based and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man dignity of man catholic and semipelagianism with all of its emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace finally views free will as the decisive factor in attaining salvation thereby conceptualizing free will as similar to a healthy man healthy human understanding for how can a person be responsible for his dee if he possesses no free will this is what erasmus asked how can he decide between good and evil so reasoned erasmus such arguments long known to luther and many times presented to him impressed him not in the least god alo is salvation god alo measures guilt he alone condemns he alone grants grace justifies and saves when he will and whom he will ma can do nothing against the divine prerogative man can only accept the divine judgment this is in fact best and if by and and it is by the divine prerogative that man will uh that man is well provided for for god alone is infallible and his being is grace and mercy this concept that man is divinely elected to salvation or to damnation is the center of the predestination dogma that later the geneva reformer calvin made the center of his teaching and that subsequently under other historical preconditions and circumstances could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class in the netherlands and in england u uh skip this paragraph this is the paragraph though right here the next one p on page three twelve when you when you read if you wanna read it later therefore luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine such arguments on the contrary necessarily appeared to luther given his theological orientation as suspicious from the very start because they originated from human nature which exalted itself against god the who reason prefers to submit to the devil adjusts to all situations and proves everything that is demanded of her human nature does not possess free will it is like a horse ridden by go or the devil the rider possesses the will the horse obeys well thats as clear as you can get it human nature is like a horse ridden by go or the devil the rider possesses free will the horse obeys alright that th_now the debate is joined you see and as you come as erasmus comes to this hes going to say well lets look at the scriptures now number one we have to admit first v first off that there see to be passages there are passages in the scriptures are there not many which see to teach that ma is responsible for his deeds and that he may act and has a free will to respond to the invitation of god isnt that clear in the scriptures whosoever wi may come um jesus turned to his disciples you remember when some deserted him and seemed because they were disappointed in some of his sayings and they were offended by some of the things he said and they walked no longer with him it said and then he turned to those who remained and he said will ye also go away they had a choice didnt they will you go away what do you will and the will apparently was re resided in in these disciples and so erasmus is going to say so obviously in scripture we ha paradox we have clea passages of scripture which seem to indicate that ma has a free will and that he can exercise that will to follow or not to follow to respond or not to respond on the other hand we have passages of scripture which seem to indicate that the will is not free and that the and that man i th is man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of god we have to take both these pass so its not a question of the scriptural authority we both accept the scriptural authority and erasmus in his writings and in his pamphlet the liber arbetrio in his pamphlet the liber arbetrio says to luther qu because it is addressed to luther you see he says to luther uh i will not church i will not question or i not i will not quote i will not quote the church fathers to you because i understand you accept no church father authority if it is in disagreement with your opinion so i will quote the only authority that you recognize the holy scriptures and so uh exclusively erasmus will appeal to the scriptures as his basis when god created adam and eve in the garden he placed them in the garden and he said you have a choice uh you have a choice do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good of the tree of good and evil for on the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die now do not do that and obviously go m have given the first created pair a choice because the whole system of reward or punishment is based upon the decision which is these individuals made or when cai slew abel u if you do we shall you not be s sustained but if you do evil sin crouches at the door if you do well apparently from this cain had the ability even after the mur uh uh even after the murder of abel he had the ab to make a positive choice according to erasmus thats going to be his position well luther um ill g ill ill tell say some of the things that he he picked first erasmus picked first and um hes gonna go all through the scriptures and hes gonna take passages like this um return return the prophets said did they not to ancient israel return to the god of the covenant return hosea pleads with gomer please come back t_you see and uh this is the symbol of israel come back to the lord come back to the the husband of the covenant come back to the one who called you and summoned you its the erasmus says the whole premise is that you have a an ability to return that you can make up your mi to change the course that youre now taking and that you can go this way or you can go that way and uh then there are other arguments which are uh heres uh heres one on um ill read an excerpt in this uh in this little book this is the um the actual uh wr writings of the s f freedom of the will heres he he uses ecclesiastes god and this is a quote from the b from the book god made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel he added his commandments and precepts if thou would keep the commandments and perform acceptable fidelity forever they shall preserve thee he hath set w he hath set water and fire before thee stretch forth thy hand to which thou wilt before man is life and death good and evil that which he shall choose shall be given him choose so erasmuss argument is you have a right to choose you can choose and therefore if you can choose this presupposes that you have a free will in any rate if man is uh if there is a necessity in mans action if he is pre to sin if if god has already determined that this person commits these acts then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor on the part of the perpetrator because how can a person be held responsible for deeds which he does if he himself did not will those the f if in other words he may will those deeds but those th those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force if that is the case then there is really no freedom of the will and if uh in that case therefore a person cannot be responsible for his deeds if the deeds which he commits have already been eternally foreordained this is uh this is going to be then erasmuss argument ag on this qu on this question of the freedom of the will but uh uh well look at another couple p uh of his passages if here it is if the will were not free sin could not be attributed to man it ceases to be sin if it is not voluntary free wi is not extinct though it has contracted a paralysis how is it paralyzed well its paralyzed by the fall see we all participate in the adamic nature a this adamic nature uh when adam in adam remember the new eng new england primer in adams fall we sinned all so this adamic nature has been has been passed on to all generation of humans and so therefore while we we have a free will it is it is paralyzed its not the will that was there its not the will that uh that adam had because it no longer has the freedom that adam had it is cursed by sin it is under the curse of sin so the human will somehow is paralyzed uh erasmus admits that and then erasmus will say that um god then enables what god does and this will be the c really the modern catholic view that god will provide a prevenient grace a prevenient grace that is in other words even though i am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation you see that um that god will give me a prevenient grace which will enable me to move toward this salvation and if i then respo positively to the gift of god then god will extend the exemplary grace to me which enables me to acquire salvation so prevenient grace will put you on the path if you respond on the path then god extends the exemplary grace which will lead you home he uses a little story a little uh uh allegory or figure i guess uh there uh theres a n theres a tot a toddler uh but hes got to be uh big enough to a apples okay because his alright because thats the thats part of the story there a nice shiny apple over here over here you see and this little tot he sees the apple a he uh he needs he wants to get to this apple u so he starts in the direction of the apple but hes very unsteady he wavers you see and hes not so what is the prevenient grace the prevenient grace is the adult which doesnt take him to the apple doesnt lift him up and put him next to the apple b but uh goes along with him just guiding him making sure that he he doesnt fall he just he lets hi get there but he just more or less supports or sustains the little tot in his motion toward the apple so the little tot you see has decided he wants the apple once he sees it uh then he he moves toward it prevenient grace assists him toward that apple it doesnt as i said it doesnt carry him there it doesnt go get the apple and bring it to him he must go to the apple but he goes sustained by this prevenient grace and then if he if he half way to the apple if he decides he doesnt want it if he if he sees something he th considers more attractive and he goes off on a tangent or goes off in a different direction then you see then his wi has decided that he does not want to cooperate with prevenient grace luther hated that word cooperation w particularly in connection with grace now luthers position is we are dead in trespasses and sin you see there is nothing that can come to us you see now luther came to his reformation remember with this fear of the righteousness of god the righteousness of god and luther all through his monastic life up until around fifteen fifteen is probably when he made that tower discovery that socalled turmerlebnis the tower experience where reading in romans one seventeen he read you know the j the just shall live by faith well you have to take rea really read romans one sixteen first u i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god onto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein therein it can only refer grammatically to gospel you see i am not ashamed of the gospel for therein is the righteousness of go revealed as it is written the just shall live by faith a when he discovered this he had read this a hundred times but this one time when he read it he said suddenly it dawned on him what this meant and this place in pau luther said became for me the gate of paradise es ging mir ein licht auf the light broke in on me and what was this light that the righteousness of god is passive righteousness its not the righteousness you see luther said i hated that that phrase righteousness of god what does righteousness of god mean righteousness of god means god is holy and im a sinner and i can never stand in his presence and the gulf between us can never be bridged and hes gonna c me into hell because of my sin what shall i do to earn the righteousness of god so you see he was constantly preoccupied with this thought of somehow satisfying the righteousness of god through some work through some indulgence through some prayer s_through through through renunciation through fasting through vigils you know he says if a monk if a m m uh if ever a monk couldve gained heaven through his monkery it would have been i you see i mean i mean if ever a monk couldve gained heaven through his monkery it wouldve been i because he d he did everything that he thought would would make god respond sympathetically to him and and pacify this righteousness and he was always miserable and then he discovered its nothing that i do its what i accept in faith namely the sacrifice of christ the vicarious sacrifice of christ for my sin on the cross i reach out i accept that as my and and then the righteousness of god is imputed to me its given to me the the just shall live by faith and so this life in god comes to you not its not god th this deus absconditus this concealed god this angry god this god whos waiting to throw you into hell at any minute that that was the image that luther had and now you see and and and works were associated with this his works what do i have to do what do i have to do to placate him what do i have to do to please him and now you see the breakthrough comes so luther from his point of view you see hes coming at it from an angle of a of an augustinian monk hes coming at it from that with this travail of soul this agony and anguish of looking for this god so he is after this discovery he is going to detest anything in theology which smacks of human effort or human work sufficient to please god or to placate god n there is nothing you can do to please god god loves you he gives you his grace totally out of his grace and n from your merit so the human will cannot you cannot decide to accept god and his grace even the gift of faith its interesting in um in bonifas in his book uh now hes a french huguenot so you would expect it but its still it comes in an interesting scene where hes in one of the camps its in the second world war hes in the concentration camp in germany and its very b its a beautifully written book and and he uh hes in this scene in this camp and you know you just wanna give up a i mean every day is youre hanging onto life by your fingernails and u he said every day we just lived for one day we lived one day at a time and then he said it dawned on me that um i i prayed i lifted up my voice to the lord we prayed together and i prayed and and he said then it came to me that what sustains me in this situation in this concentration camp what sustains me is my my d f in god and then he said and then it dawned on me that this deep faith which i have in god is not my creation well thats interesting isnt it this faith was given me i did not create it i did not conjure it up it came to me it was given to me thats the testimony of a huguenot inmate in a concentration camp well lets take a break i just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule um originally we were going to require the um request fo statement of interest and qualifications to come back to uh twenty north clark street on april seventh um but the um coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community more time a weekend two days to uh augment whatever application people were gonna submit so the due date is changed from april seventh to april eleventh at noon and you can drop off those proposals at twenty north clark street um the same process will continue but for the changes in the time at the time that you drop off your proposal you will be scheduled for a uh public meeting where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your uh proposal um right now were looking at april fifteenth which is a friday and s and april sixteenth as the uh date for that public presentation and we dont know where that will be held or what time that will be held but well make sure that everyone gets noticed about that during april seventeen to the twentythird the coordinating council will identify the empowerments on location a uh during the week of uh a twen there will be a citywide meeting to present the selected empowerment zone uh to go over how that zone was selected a uh the place date and time for that meeting will also be announced um from may second to june third the strategic plan for the empower zone will be developed with the community a during the week of june sixth um a public presentation of on the uh empowerment zone application and the strategic plan will presented be presented again the place date and time will be announced um and on june thirtieth thats the drop dead date um when we will send the application for selection by hud as an empowerment zone for chicago um is if there are no other questions um we can yes sir i have a question yeah worst case scenario after we submit em the uh the proposal application uh human beings being what they are organizations being what they are what will the coordinating council what does the city propose to do when theres a hue and cry from those who attempting to empower themselves a combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power who say unfair this wasnt done right according to our perspective or this that and the other that would be the worst case scenar x worst case scenario what can the city what what can the coordinating council or whats gonna be p be in place to listen to all the criticisms all of the disappointments at not being selected so that lets say optimistically there are some good ideas s oversight or something that can be corrected hopefully thats of minor proportion so that we can still keep the city running smoothly and becoming more and more beautiful i dont know if that issue has been discussed by the um coordinating council i think its a legitimate issue u i w y would be willing to take that back to have them discuss that but i mean the worst thing would be for hud not to recognize that this is a c collaborative effort a partnership between the community the city the business community and the neighborhoods and i mean it wouldnt bode well for chicago to get an empowerment zone if if everyone were not supportive and on board so i mean that answers your question i dont know what the coordinating councils role in that case would be but well definitely take that message back on that question i may i propose that the coordinating council consider my individual worst case scenario and any other worst case scenarios that they collectively might come up with notwithstanding paul xxs suggestion that the empowerment zone moneys a hundred million cta green line threehundred million be utilized effectively and efficiently to get a bigger bang for the buck kay xx i just wanted to say that theres also some other opportunities for um organizations that are new in the networking process and i think that the more meetings you can attend and the more organizations that hear your voice the better theres uh a networking meeting going on on friday at nine thirty in the morning at the mega center and its free its its a its a group of assist and nonassist agencies um organizations like crcc the mega center the cobcu womens business development center small business development center i couldnt even begin to mention the list because theres about twentyfive different assist and nonassist agencies on there but i think that anybody who belongs to an organization um that has any type of connection with the city it would be good to twentysixth where this one is friday at nine thirty at the mega center the bank right thats the bank x x its one o five west adams on the seventh floor at what time nine im sorry its nine to tenthirty okay i i i i have a clue that she gave me but ill make arrangements on it mhm the lady in the yellow sweater actually i was again i was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario the alderman spoke to you feel that somehow the process that has been established um could divide the city best case scenario would be the uh provisions were made such that the ideas that come out and the collaborations that come out of this process and let them continue whether or not the city of chicago is designated for anything that that some reassurance of what comes out of it could be um somehow taken into consideration and continue to be fostered from the city of chicago i think the city is i mean i know the city is committed to that and i know that that has come up at the i um the coordinating council meeting a desi to work continue to work with people no matter what happens on this issue and theres been some discussion about u other kinds of funds that could be put towards implementing uh uh areas plans in areas that are not selected um so i think there is a commitment to do that and that that certainly has been the spirit of the um coordinating council you and then paul um ive got uh three questions for you uh and i suppose your response is gonna just kinda xx on there but first um does the city have any idea how many uh requests theyre gonna how many proposals that theyre gonna be getting do you have an estim no so at least one im sure u s uh well that kind of leads into my my next question i think touches on these peoples questions as far as uh it seemed like it would behoove us all if there were some kind of consensus building process before uh this went on and so what people are saying theyre having community meetings community organiza uh community uh group meetings but uh its from what i understand of this empowerment zone process the idea is to really involve things on a g grassroots level a my two concerns on par as far as participation goes are o that a and i voiced this concern with elder jarret when uh last month at the uh washington or uh washington library center when they uh xx the person introduced that a that is simply throwing this out into the community and saying that you expect the community to be able to respond community groups to be able to respond to you is i think it at l at least not an effective uh instrument for for getting this done uh i think that thats the expecta of the it doesnt it doesnt address of the xxxx uh it doesnt address the fact that one community organizations um and many are of them being service providers do not necessarily ha the same goals in mind as community residents do theyve got different agendas theyve got different priorities theyve got different purposes than members of the r the community themselves u the second thing is that people who do not live directly inside the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zo theyve got an overriding concern in this because as mister pollack said a hundred million dollars is just gonna be a drop in the bucket to be able to make these things work and especially to make them work over a ten year process that this is calling for therere gonna be a lot of community resources s uh from the federal government from the state county and city that are gonna need to be marshalled theyre gonna need to be reallocated to this area and to be able to have a consensus not just within the empowerment zone but within the city itself if these services are gonna be provided and maintained over the ten years through different administrations through different aldermen political processes involved these people are not being brought into the decisionmaking process beforehand and i think this speaks to these peoples concern that these people meaning who the i i heard several people this this r i dont know their names so ill just have to woman in yellow gentleman here in the glasses that theres gonna be uh uh uh earlier that very first speaker gentleman uh ed smith uh that youre gonna be receiving a number of proposals and you say you dont know how many i dont know how youre gonna have twentyeight thirtytwo people that you said on a coordinating council read maybe a hundred proposals within a weeks time and be able to arrive at one selected empowerment zone it seems to me that it be much more beneficial if the entire community as a whole was brought into this process and this is what im bringing up is the idea of participation true communitybased citizen participation would involve ongoing series of meeting that i would think that the coordinating council would be promoting would be organizing and directing on an uh ongoing uh even nightly basis thats not exact grassroot planning to be either right um grassroot planning is when people get out in the community and organize but they need a forum and do the work they need if this woman here today did not speak up a let me answer your question all these people here would not even know a meeting was going on let me try to respond to your ques sir so uh what youre suggesting is not a grassroot in my opinion a grassroot process secondly the the the reality is we only have till june thirtieth to submit an application a really a true strategic planning process grassroot takes many more months than that many more years than we have xx okay so we have to do the best that we can do given the time that we have and all im saying is im saying that i dont believe a forum is being presented for community groups to i mean some people are finding out about this for the first time tonight some people are finding out about meetings that are going on with other groups for the first time tonight this is not being promoted by the city this is not being publicized as a forum as a it has been pro it has been publicized i dont know ill tell you right now that the leading onprofit affordable housing provider on the west side isnt even involved with this he said he hasnt even xxx pride has not even been contacted by those groups on the west side well let me tell you ive worked with pride and i had a meeting with pride last week they know about it i didnt say they didnt know about it i said theyre not being theyre not being contacted by y as far as being brought into a network for this im im sorry im not trying to be confrontational okay im trying to raise issues and concerns alright although i do think the second my second qu that the organization has a responsibility if theyre interested in this undoubtedly undoubtedly and they care about empowerment of th of their constituency undoubtedly to get involved in the process and find a way to make that happen xx m my second question would be on the process uh the city obviouslys got its own priorities its got u funds already allocated in budget its got areas designated that they would like to see worked on a my question as far as the process is c way the selection goes are um what w which is gonna drive which how much weight are gonna be given to u proposals which dovetail into existing programs that the city has or that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas and how much is the city willing to bend and say i will g we are gonna forego these uh scheduled or proposed projects to be able to dovetail into empowerment zones whats being said patty is when is the city going to present say for instance its overall plan for conducting the city so everyone can see their seat in the auditorium or their place around the table and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development when will their interests be served so this empowerment zone it simply seems to me is opening a pandoras box go ahead well to let me answer your question in terms of the um uh proposed plans i mean right now the um coordinating council is making the selection based on the information tha is received from the community and obviously there uh there are other issues to look at for example um organizations that may be involved in um current work their ability new organizations new ideas i mean all that is getting is thrown in the pot and i dont think that any community that has an existing plan has a leg up o any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan uh are they explaining the uh for example i dont know if londa white is here s uh theoretical at a uh a uh community meeting last month in which uh a lot of uh selection criteria were uh drawn up i was wondering if is the council gonna absorb that into the selection process also the council has uh received a copy of that and the council has seen portions of uh of the seaway principles some of those principles have been are included in what we have tonight others are really principles fo the zo itself and how the makeup of the zone will be and that is going to be handed out to the uh coordinating council this thursday uh m m my third question is on the final program i think this gentleman again spoke very very adequately to it u it seems to me again this idea of building consensus that if were able to make this a program like this work over such a long time that the city and in fact its stated in the uh uh proposal the uh hud application proposal that the uh governing body making the application must provide a and evidence that this uh uh empowerment zone plan is gonna be adhered to and implemented and it seems to me that one of the most fundawen fundamental and best ways to have this done would be for the city to come up with a com plan that follows guidelines that would ensure that whats happening in the empowerment zone is indeed the seed program thats gonna be followed and be able to be dis distributed to other areas of the city and and built on in other areas of the city does the city have any uh plans uh any any hope of coming up with a comprehensive plan for developing the city we do not have a comprehensive plan for the city of chicago does the city have we have any hopes of policies for development and we have been identifying places that have plans and trying to get things done a comprehensive plan requires uh the infusion of many many dollars much more than is available you know within the city budget to implement a plan a at this point we are looking at ways to be strategic in how we invest our money and the empowerment zone is an e is an example of an of an area where we are going to do some strategic planning along with the community which will lead to implementation and investing in our plan correct would you say its only we only have policy guidelines and when when administrations change policies change what im talking about is that cities that we are competing against seattle san antonio minneapolis theyve got comprehensive plans for the development of their cities and that some of them do and some of them do not the ones that i just mentioned do uh alright and my point is some of them do that and some of them do not the ones that i just mentioned do and my my point is that it seems to us that it it it seems to me that it would give us as chicago a much better footing with government if we said that we had a comprehensive plan that was gonna ensure that these things are going to be well sir xx xx x considering that our plan is due june thirtieth and considering that between now and then we will not have a comprehensive plan for the city of chicago u im not quite sure where to go with your question oh im s im sorry oh go ahead go ahead bernie i ha i just wanted to make a friendly remind x im sorry derek um my names derek williams im im with the horn association of men a uh i i think we need to recognize that uh uh this is an opportunity and its not a threat uh consensus do not build themselves a and if we just be perfectly honest with each other the only reason that were all in this room is because we hear about a hundred million dollars and thats what everybodys worried about uh its impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan because we dont have comprehensive people first of all and i think we just need to given the information thats out there we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents uh be honestly speaking with you uh i come from an organization with five hundred members and empowerment zone has absolutely no meaning to just about eighty percent of our population for the simple reason we get caught up in in in all of the rhetoric u we we constantly challenge each other and i i dont think this is the time for that i i think we should be trying to focus o the information thats available and and and meet the challenge and i and i think we can do that and in and again this is an opportunity to m the challenge thanks derek thats why i guess youre sitting in the front row um paul derek i i appreciate following you thanks well see idve been kinda frustrated trying to say what you said some of it id like to just for a couple minutes set the record straight o what empowerment zones are and what they are not according to my own understanding the empowerment zones were implemented under the clinton administration they did not start under the clinton administration they started in the state of illinois as enterprise zones back in the eighties the difference between empowerment zones and enterprise zones is that the federal government for twelve years congress never did approve enterprise zones at the federal level by the time they were approved congress in its wisdom attached funding criteria and shifted the name from enterprise zones to empowerment zones for the record i do not live in cha i am not homeless i do not transport myself on cta properties im a veteran so i do not go to county hospitals i abide by the law so im not in county jail i have attended several colleges i think successfully they think unsuccessfully so i do not need the public education system in chicago but i do know who does need em the homeless and people not in public housing public housing because one were getting ready to tear them all down what are we gonna do with it the city has no right would be in a fight we need to try and tell me what my block needs when my block decides what it needs and presents its plan to the city then the city can take its logical legal jurisprudence course of identifying what resources it has and make em available the empowerment zones what are by legislation to be planned by with and for those most in need of empowering it dont mention those agencies most in need this is not the entitlement programs see the entitlement programs is what has turned the west side into a damn desert of oasis and poverty because the west side was planned for cha was planned for the city has put together in a aggregate sum the map that is about two pages that shows you where the poorest folks live if you are an agency that is involved in those areas take the opportunity to find out what those people need and deliver the proposal if you are an agency that is outside of those areas of the census track that each of you have then cha your location do like reagan said and move with your feet into the area this is no you know three card molly here we al know where the most empower people are get busy patty asked a question earlier i have chose not to do it but out of necessity im gonna ask you to walk through this this is where the poor folks live this is where your tax dollars are going and this is why you get upset every time the city launches a project because you say it comes in over budget this is where the state has roads going on this is where county hospital has roads going on so as far as im concerned if the city did anything more than what it was doing i would file a grievance with the department of justice to say that they were in violation of the legislation the legislation says that tho who have nothing are either to be courted by those who have something or left alone so that they can develop their own plan and be responsible for their success or their failure that to me is the empowerment zone anything else is a contradiction malcolm x we sitting in the college named after him he said by whatever means necessary so by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get gautonomous touched contagious in in love with poor folks is what is gonna take to keep your agencies empowered thank you paul um before we close we have uh several members of the coordinating council here who id like to recognize and see if they want to add anything before we leave uh here tonight um we have sproule white who is the executive director of the chicago jobs council um wanda white who is the executive director of the community work on economic development and ted wysaki who is the executive director of uh cando the chicago association of neighborhood development organizations and also frank grossman was here from continental bank and also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee do you wanna say anything okay ill just make one point and ill make it brief and that is coo alright folks well alreet well alroot well alright by now im sure youre wondering about the different things that i have on the table here but first i would like to talk to you about these three items i have here some ice in a pan water in this glass and steam rising from this pot now i would like to ask you how these three things tell me please how are they all alike these three things this ice here in this pan this water in this glass and the steam rising from this pot just yell it out w are informal here yes correct they are all forms of water this ice here of course is water i told you there was water in this glass and you have all seen water boil at home so you are familiar with steam but now lets try to figure out how theyre different well look at temperature first and the temperature o this water here the ice i about uh twentyfour n_woo nineteen degrees very cold the temperature o this w water here is sixtyfour degrees the temperature of this steam i i know its hotter than that yeah its about a hundred a eleven degrees okay fahrenheit okay oh and by the way guys what do we call something thats hard like this ice here or a table or a rock we call it a solid very good you should g you should be a choir you should go out on the road there like yeah we are y oh well im glad to meet you plea give me your itinerary after the show yes yes of course we call it a sholids a solid and a solid has one shape the shape that it starts out with and what do we call something that you that you can splish splash take a bath in anything wet like soda or milk liquid youre not gonna let me finish are you yes we call it a liquid very good and a liquid can change its shape to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in and finally what do we call something thats loose and floating around like this steam here o a cloud or the air we breathe we call it a gas correct a gas and a ga completely fi whatever shape container you put it in and so how do you get water to change from a solid to a liquid to a gas and back and forth add energy woo i like the way he expressed that never before have i heard it a or subtract energy o heat change the temperature basically correct alright well folks now im going to show you something else that happens when you change the temperature and thats where these balloo come in i have here a number of balloons but l lets see how many of these balloons i can fit into this little ittybitty container here well everybody count together this would be theres a xx in there you think well okay w th th im glad i never saw d citizen cane with you rosebud is a sled okay well lets all count together folks that wa one one very good one balloon going into the little container here and this would be two two ve good counting there two excellent two balloons going into the little container here ah theyre not fitting in so easily oh no so hopefully i can fit all balloons into this little container he x xx xxxxxx oh stop guessing at what this is lets have some suspense here come o alright and this would be three three very good three balloons going onto the the little container there three balloons three yes the balloon trinity and now this would be eight four four very good at first he was confused but then he figured it out everybody tell him what this is its seven its four boy you people didnt watch enough sesame street as a child this would be five thank you very much yes fi swollen balloo in in dow down ah ah okay and this would be six six good and lets do this uh lets add some complexities to this here lets do it in another language in spanish it would be o seis s seis n ocho oh my gosh im afraid for our nation okay well and this would be siete thank you seve right seven okay and finally this would be eigh ocho eight or ocho in spanish and uh huit in french thank you very much i thought you were telling me your breakfast what you had for b but no huit very good oh my gosh eight balloons into this little container here i bet youre wondering r how that happened you popped two theres a hole in it well theres a hole no if youre thinking theres a hole think again because theres no hole in the counter at all pull em out you slowed down the molecules well la duh dah dih duh duh youre getting a little ahead of me son lets all figure it out together you popped them and we can get a better idea of whats happening to the balloons if we go back and look at the water again no i did not pop them youre what y what y do you heckle every scientific person this is really terrible im gonna take some of this hot water here and pour it into this flask here and put a balloon over the top of the flask ah alright and now i will heat up this water using my bunsen burner does it use real bunsen is that what youre asking me alright here we go the we go alright im using the fire now to heat up the water but lets behave like scientists now and watch and observe and take note of what we see okay now folks what do we see well if we look very closely we can see condensation here on the sides of this flask and steam rising up from the water going up into the balloon making the balloon blow up woo dont want too much heat there oh we can also start to see bubbles in the water the water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask turned into a g that had enough force to fill up this balloon thats what we call boiling folks and im sure you do too turning from a liquid into a gas now if i took the t balloon if i took the balloon off the top of this flask here and put the water into the freezer what do you think would happen to the water it would freeze and turn into a solid solid correct but it would still be water yes youre right whether its a solid a liquid or a gas so lets think about what water is made up of well water is made up of atoms yeah everything is made up of atoms solids liquids gasses now in water two atoms of what ato uh element yes hydrogen very good hydrogen and one atom of what oxygen oxygen i know you wanted to say it but hes my pet okay x a all these atoms combine to form a molecule of water and thats what a molecule is folk a group of atoms hanging out having a good time together and they call the water molecule aich two o alright so folks how do you suppose the molecules in this water goodbye guys i ill miss you how do you suppose the molecules in this water when its ice are different from the molecules in the water when its a liquid and different still from the water from the molecules in the water when its steam fast do you know yes theyre not moving x thats right its th its movement my friends you see a molecules move not just in water but in everything in the universe even you the molecules are moving but to get a better understanding of how those m interact lets pretend these pingpong balls here are molecules well folks in a solid like this ice here or a table the molecules are moving ve slowly alright and theyre very close together in fact theyre in a v joined uniform state okay they move very coolly slowly and thats what its like in a solid like the ice but in a liquid the molecules are moving a little more quickly okay so you have some fluidity of movement within a fixed volume okay theyre a little mo further apart there but in a gas look at that theyre moving ve quickly indeed alright theyre moving so fast they completely fill the shape container uh thats what its like in a gas and temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow molecules are moving so if you have slow moving molecules what temperature do you have people yes cold or low temperature and if you have fast moving molecules what type of temperature do you have hot hot or high temperature youre right but not every substance beco a solid a liquid and a gas at the same temperatures as water does and that brings us back to the mystery of our disappearing balloons now inside this container here into which our balloons ah i am losing my spheres inside this container into which our balloons have disappeared i have a liquid im going to take some of that liquid and examine it much in the same way that i did the water yeah alright guys lets watch now and see what occurs im going to pour this liquid into this flask here and again we will behave like scientists and watch and observe and see what we n now here is a liquid that is bubbling and steaming like the water was when there were the f when there was a fla underneath it but theres no flame underneath this liquid here n_thats different lets see what happens when i put a balloon o the top if we do in fact have a liquid thats turning into a gas with enough force to fill up a balloon and lo and beho we do it i filling up the balloon here but this steam here is very cold and we can see that frost is forming on the sides of this flask here frost my god thats curious lets see what the temperature is of this liquid uh xxx did you guys come from a deprived home or something you didnt have balloons fighting over balloo i never thought id see the day im going to put this probe here into this liquid and we will see what temperature this balloon is uh try to stay in your seats i dont want you guys to run up throughout the show okay now the temperature of this liquid i threehundred and twentythree degrees below zero water becomes a solid at thirtytwo degrees above zero and it remains a solid at every tenjure temperature below that so folks do you think this threehundred and twentythree degree l i water no no thats right go ahead and shake your heads in disbelief of course its not water no this folks is liquid n ah ye where folks can you find lots of nitrogen uh in hes like uh doing this i thought he had bad breath yes the air youre breathing right now your lungs are filled with this stuff all of you the air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen a uh its oxygen and other gasses as well okay our body takes it all in but we only u the oxygen we breathe out the nitrogen the reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs as it is doing this flask here is because those molecules are moving much faster the nitrogen is w probably about seventy degrees i would imagine but this liquid is ve cold indeed threehundred and twentythree degrees below zero well to get exactly to get an idea about how cold that is lets use these two bouncing rubber balls i would like you people in the audience to examine the balls to let me know if they are in fact average normal everyday balls testify for the audience dont b into it jeesh youve really havent been fed have you oh im really feeling sorry for you please bounce it back now no dont bounce it throw it anywhere else throw it in the water right under the water that was im surprised i caught that normally im f_try to goof im like michael jordan in the white sox but anyway but this time i caught it so lets see what happens when one of these balls goes into the liquid nitrogen now the other one stays out here with me where its nice and warm well lets think now about whats happening to this ball its in the ve cold liquid nitrogen right so what do you think is happening to the ball is the ball getting hotter or colder everybody say it out lou hotter colder colder okay some people dont agree with you in fact most people dont yes its getting colder so if the ball is getting colder do you think the ball m are going faster or slower slower slower okay and that you all concur that is excellent so if these molecules are going slower do you think and the ball is getting colder do you think the ball is becoming more of a solid or more of a liquid what do you think liquid a l only one person thinks that cause everybody didnt want to go all that far out on a limb so lets see if uh sh if what this guy is thinking is true if it becomes more of a liquid or more of a solid i will take this ball out o the liquid nitrogen and we will begin the experiments okay now lets see they look alike dont they they still look pretty much the same except we have steam coming off this ball here lets see if they bounce as before well this one m bounces pretty much the same but this one is different that is curious hmm well i must continue my study lets see how they react under pressure okay alright this one pretty much is absorbing my energy it remains intact but lets see what happens to this ball did it break no it broke you see these molecules got slower and slower and slower a closer together the ball became more of a solid than before it became harder well folks that kinda k it gives you a little bit of an idea of whats happening to our balloons but it still doesnt make it absolutely clear so and well see what happens to this b old balloon when it interacts with liquid n alright rather than see what happens tha there and guess at whats happening to these balloons in the container we will see what happens to a balloon when it interacts with liquid nitrogen in the light of day alright im pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon so the balloon and its contents the air insi is getting colder and colder and colder okay those molecules are slowing down theyre going slower and slower and so theyre getting closer and closer together okay you still have the same num of air molecules inside this balloon as you did before its just that theyre going slower so theyre closer together and they take up less space in this balloon and look at the balloon at the very bottom of it you can see a liquid thats the air people how often do you get to see liquified air but that is the air the molecules have gotten so slowed down and so close together that theyre less theyre not in the as much in the form of a gas now theyre more in the form uh uh of a liquid but now the air around it is causing those molecules to speed up ha ha and so the molecules are speeding up theyre getting further and further apart and taking up more space inside the balloon so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape so that has to be whats happening to the balloons that are inside this container here alright yes these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen and so those molecules slowed down and got closer together the air took up less space inside the balloons so i can fit a those balloons into this little ittybitty container but now im taking the balloons out of this container so the molecules a speeding up the air is heating up okay and so the molecules are going faster and faster and theyre getting further and further apart theyre taking up less space insi im sorry taking up more and more space inside these balloons and you might want to protect your eardrums cause sometimes as these balloons expand they pop and let me tell you i get quite shell shocked at the end of the day so this really teaches us a lot people this tells us that the dif ow the difference in a substance between a solid a liquid and a gas like water i how fast the molecules are moving and that different substances become a solid a liquid and a gas at different temperatures and temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow molecules are moving thats what i wanted to tell you people i love to share that with everyone that i meet if you have any questions about this or any other subject come on up and ask even if you dont i certainly hope you have a great day here at the museum of science and industry x oh thank you very much uh someones been shot hello hows my favorite girl in the world hey ba whos whos the girl that i love whos the g that ill do anything for ill wa her feet with my mouth aw honey h are you after a ten mile run ew i would ew i would ew how are you ho uh im doing good i miss you uh i miss you too hm hows my fa girl im good is she is she okay unhu are you guys having fun yes im so glad aw m what are you going into purr mo oh gosh we kept missing you hunh i know its been a while last night and today its been a long time its been so long i know you missed like all the drama here no dra yeah there was such drama there was drama and there was suspense and then there was relief and then there was ecstasy no well ill not the ecsta ecstasy of sorts u wait tell me what well see i the reas i have i kinda i wasnt inclined to call you unh because i just wan to give you and jill your time yeah you know like i felt like totally you know so thats i let there were a couple times when i wanted to call you and i didnt for that reason uh unhu aw thanks yeah well the thing was i hadnt told you but my period is r l you know and i guess we would talk and then wed hang up and then i thought oh go i forgot to tell you but ive been meaning to ask you about that really you were getting nervous you havent had it yet no i mean and its been so long and so its like eight days late and i thought im su im pregnant im p and i was waiting till jill got here thats ba to even try to check oh yeah and um so we went to go get an ept at pregnancy test yeah and then we d thats why we were calling you last nigh you know what happened and then of course it came out fine so thats the it came out negative yeah so thats the relief and the ecstasy so y you cant be pregnant no i dont no un it was a false negative x which i doubt because thats rare right right i think that would be really rare so th you know what i mean like can would it come out nega lets say i i if you were pregnant in its early st early early stages mhm like wo like would a negative you know what im saying m like could you get is it possible that you could still be posi positive i think thered be a slight chance of it being a false negative but i dont think so cause im pretty late and i think im late enough where i would have like enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test tests for i think i would have enough of that in my urine that of course it would show up if i had any in there yeah you know so i i im pret i took that as a pretty good sign oh my god you know honey how come youve been keeping all this in i know i didnt mean to keep it in x i mean i didnt mean dont you love me oh aw i didnt mea to not tell you at all it was just we would hang up the phone then i thought oh yeah i forgot to mention that im kinda late cause i didnt think it was a huge deal but then i guess i wasnt trying i think i was in a bit of denial like i wasnt really thinking about it much you know cause i knew once jill got here then i would go get the test so is that all the drama that was the drama and that was the suspense and that was the relief and that was the ecstasy really unhunh oh honey oh little b is going through the whole wide spectrum of emotions shes doing it without me shes going solo on this im going solo this is jillpan going solo i know i thought it was so funny last night like what if it came back positive and then that would mean the next time i talked to you id be telling you that i was pregnant and then i thought gosh poor jeff like i hadnt given you any like you know like i hadnt warned you or anything and it would have been such a surpri totally i thought oh my gosh i was even g that wouldve been gonna bring the camera into the bathroom to take a picture of the ept cause i thought x you know its like such a momentous occasion like what if it came out pos and then i thought of

things about me no us who u no thats a wrong clow crowd hunh aw well give me the highlights the highlights yeah of what we talk about you yeah u let me think let me think of some good ones condense it down to a minute okay we said something so funny today and i thought when jill said it it captured you so well and we both laughed cause i think it was just so funny how well we both know you um i guess we were talking about i dont know what came up we were talking about tv or television shows and i mentioned yeah you really you like to watch mash mhm and she laughed and said yeah cant you just picture jeff sitting on his couch and watching mash with some orange juice with ice cubes and we started laughing and jill went thats jeffs slice of heaven like little piece of heaven and we just thought it was so f because like it really captured you uh like we both know youd be sitting there with orange juice with ice cube only i havent had ice cubes here since september are you serious yeah because you know how big t thick the freezer gets unhunh i just dont even bother i just keep it at a high temperature unhunh for or i keep it really cool so its cold enough for me oh so youre absolutely right i drink orange juice but i go through like a carton of orange juice every two days honey impressive hunh aw the old la oh she just loo at me and then you know what i just realized what she looked at me she was walking down the stairs unhunh she looked at me and she d she didnt see me really yeah i waved at her and she just kept going maybe um if theres a reflection or something what a body she has isnt that incredible are our bodies gonna do that its like its like shes evolving you know like its funny or degenerating no degener yeah its kinda weird hunh yeah the whole cycle of life what a fucking tr i know oh but di i d uh i know you would you get excited about things like this too but did you read in the paper about the um planets cir circulating around other stars no what about them theres irr irreb irred theres proof whats the whats the word that goes before proof irrefutable irrefutable proof whats the word that goes before proof there thank you honey that was so good what a good team we are i could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and like oh honey by the way whats that word that that goes befo honor irrefutable jeff im like oh yes yes yes thank you very much what would i b without her um wouldnt that be funny uh yeah aw honey wouldnt that be funny that would be like if someone was lecturing and they said they looked at you they said is my wife here m_well and then she raises her hand oh honey what wor were we talking about the other night whats that word im looking for honey you know when you know what im talking about i wouldnt the whole place just laugh yeah i think its so funny okay anyway can i r this by you real quick unhunh there this scientist that came up with irrefutable proof that there are there they found two planets circulating around a sun or a star in the universe outside of our solar system really uh and so which like made me think you know like you know like how we have always talked about life being out there you know unhunh like there has to be cause theres planets evolving around um unhunh you know various stars and stuff just like ours unh and but see i never knew that that was just a theory you know an a theory that there were planets going around other stars you mean you actually thought that we had seen this before no no actually tha i i no i didnt i just i just thought that it was like pretty much factual oh yeah x not at all so you know so its kind of like a leap of faith you know that uh we have always thought that m you know i mean like like the scientist who who does it cant really prove it like they they make this leap of faith you know they just assume right that there w there were planets m around other suns right right just by the sheer numbers they thought well what are the chances you know if we have billions and millions of stars then chances are you know even if it takes like one in a million chance for there to be another planetary system well like x we have millions and millions and billions of opportunities to have that happen un so i think thats the whole thing like carl sagan would always go yeah billions and billions like he would say that unhunh i think he would say that but yeah so anyhow like w in what galaxy like what solar like what what galaxy was this star in uh santa barbara no im not sure i dont know the the details but anyway what it made me think about was the fact that you know how you always this might sound a little silly m but you know how like you like i i im very passionate about certain ideas you know really like you know what i mean yes how and then youre like more scientific or youre more you know open to other possibilities unhunh you know like in like you know like youre ch u just uh even with people but with the ide like you would like you would ask like how do you know for sure you know m a its like you know like the oh i dont know where was i going with this that and now here it is here is the factual proof and so i can be satisfied that yeah well just to show you that you know like you ca make an assumption and you can assume something that feels you know really correct and and it turns out to be that way sure some of the time uh yeah i feel like well if you also felt that i dont know you could feel something that wouldnt be proved right yeah but no but i think thats so exciting honey no its okay honey i didnt see that in the news its okay sweetie oh i did it was more exciting when i was thinking about it the other night no its so exciting i mean i im s no my whole idea about i mean its so exciting that i d like dont even believe you like i think its that exciting oh my god i mean like i feel like its you dont believe me no its so exciting that i feel like thats i want to go read it in the newspaper for myself like i cant believe it like how come its not on the news and i know there arent like parties now and they even u theyve been studying the two planets mhm and their patterns and how they like s um they they circle the the their star unhunh a they think that theres not it cant those planets cant sustain life oh just from the distance from it uh no from um like from their surface the the planets surface oh they can see that well thats weird they get it from like they pick up heat waves oh you know and its its just obviously they cant se really see anything they the only way they could tell that the planets are out there like they can tell like the stars are are out there are just by radio waves and and how you know what god thats so incredible and heat waves uh i t i its unbelievable how man has you know like from this little point in the whole universe like weve been able to tell so much just with science i know isnt it wild xx just with aw thats so incredible that sends me out there w t oh w thats so exciting oh honey youre not pregnant no im s y you were convinced you were pregnant well i only got convinced the moment before i was waiting for the results like all before that uh well im late but i dont feel any of the symptoms but i got so nervous right when i was taking the test i was kind of not treating it taking it that seriously cause its just its such an un concept to think that maybe i would be pregnant so i was really believing it x and then but the moment that i did the test i got so scared and i thought oh my god like this isnt kidding around like what if i am and its a distinct possibility and i got so scared like you did you cry no i didnt cry but jill was here like she wa it was so scary and but you know we were watching it and it didnt turn blue or aw you know so it was you know it was are you sure it would have been mine you know i wouldve denied it if you if you said it was mine i was uh messing around with the repair man honey aw honey im just kidding my love youd sure learn a lot about me if that happened gosh aw honey that would just like ruin your whole idea of who i am hunh aw it would just like id just bl up everything that we had if i if i was that cruel if you just refuted it if i said no way t nunhunh im not taking any responsibility if its mine then its your fault for getting pregnant oh god would oh no you think wed be able to to make it through that if i i dont think s would you would you be able to look above that would you forgive that just let that one thing pass no way i wouldnt let you oh well i just want you to get pregnant so you could see how uh im gonna take it s oh ill love you and s you m send you some money gr oh sweetness oh what a pain in the ass that would be i know you know what i think m m out of anything it would just be that that would bother me just like i dont have the ti to dea with it like w you know like what a pain in the neck xx we have to be really safe this summer totally well im gonna go on the pill oh honey are you sure yeah yeah totally it its yeah what are we gonna use condoms right well theyre coming out with condoms for women right well i would never in a million years expect you to wear something like that honey i swear to god i think those are the grossest contraptions ever i saw one act really yeah i just saw one the other day actually theyre strange looking wow x xx we had a woman um a physician come and talk to us about all the different kinds of contraception and um to tell us about r u four eightysix is that the drug unhunh unhunh to tell us about that and norplant and the side effects of everything and it was so interesting wow yeah well is r u um forty six it was really neat is that gonna be implemented well its not its not available here in the united states its only in fr england and yeah and swede right but i mean is that are they are there people trying to make it law here i think so but i just think you know politically i i doubt it will be yeah for a while such a b yeah its such a great you know that would be so great if people could get that oh yeah stay away from those prolifers throwing things at em oh i know i know gosh you know what sweetie i think im gonna go like rescue jill because shes been there and shes probably doesnt know anybody and you know okay honey you youre choosing you can choose oh honey im just kidding oh im so glad you guys are having a good time n_yeah oh its so great its so great aw well give its so nice it give her a hug for me okay its almost surreal having her here excuse me hey how are you guy are you larry are you larry yes how are you are you youre the guy hunh youre the guy to talk to then im the guy yeah i didnt know if i had the right place yeah you got it i just what are you doing there youre probably trying t yeah this is strange whats this guy doing im putting water in a twentysix gallon container inside my truck wow thats quite a p cause i had to haul it to a property which doesnt have any water and i have to spray the road ah cause the road before you can drive on it interesting it needs more uh more stability evidently so give me one second to lock this thing and then xx is that to keep the dust keep the dust down well no its not that so much its uh they put they put a uh a type of uh base on it that needs water and that just hasnt happened yet oh x i see so theres some chemical reaction that has to take place yeah i guess a good a analogy chelsea no that should hold it in there okay nice to meet you how you doing good to see you whats your name seth seth okay heres my card here thanks seth i think its warming up a bit here is this the house were looking at ill take you down in the basement is the furnace down in the basement whats left of it yeah we had all these is it a ol system yeah we had the asbestos uh all removed from it and and uh oh really so thats been done i was j i was just at a place that does asbestos removal yeah where cal cal tech theyre the guys that did it are they alright yeah thats down in berkeley right no theyre theyve got an office here in nappa cal tech what was the no synergy thats who synergy dif different one i im sorry its a different outfit i didnt know they had one up here yeah though i think they had just recently mo here unhunh cause i was wondering t so wheres the man with the uh camera and the oh i got the i got my record right here thats pretty clever yeah my brother is uh teaches linguistics and i guess hes doing this study oh okay and they just want business conversations alright well wow heres the animal my go w they took uh some of it with em obviously did this used to be used to be an old oil yeah i think it was an old fire i think it was an old see the oil tank here isnt that an oil tank yeah thats what my guess is a uh wow do you have a flashlight on you sure do yeah so then you get duct work or is this the flue we yeah what they did thats the flue i guess they they took the stubs and they cleaned em up so you can tie right into em see yeah so this used to have asbestos hunh yeah where did all this connect was there a a plenum on top of here so yeah there was a bi hood that went over the top of this thing with these stack that went this way okay yeah like an octopus type and then one that goes back un underneath there to the to the uh kitchen there are there are different there are different ones that kinda go all the way up i see one r theres a rectang one right there yeah is that one right there w that im flashing my light on yeah it might be it kinda looks like it and then there was theres one farther up and then there is this one here so you have one two three at least two there three and then theres another one way down i dont know if you can see it or not but its its up into the kitchen so theres probably three back there and a and any over on this side well no but what what we we want to p you to kinda give us an idea on a w what your thoughts are you wanna add a c add a few more add a couple yeah back ee way back there is that one way back cant see it xx get this thing to help to a point i dont know what this was looks like they that was connected to one of em yeah they left that here i dont see any back in here but well theres theres definitely one back there now theres nothing out here and this is where we feel we we should add one is this is a gonna be a dining room okay so uh one for one there for sure what abou uh what about above this section of the house well let me show you that and you can give you can give me some idea about that as well now uh you are on propane out here no this is natural gas oh really yeah oh good kinda rare thats good because uh the problem with propane is that they wouldnt be able to v the co the county would probably have a problem with it yeah cause theyre very concerned about propane but natural gas i can put a yeah we were real happy to get this place with natural gas do you want me to remove the old furnace well not have to no uh do you want me to remove it oh yes okay yeah no thats that would be part of our deal yeah well y the new furnace w would be much smaller that much i can guarantee you alright do you x how many square feet is the house uh well i guess its around twentyeight approximately okay i have a roof guy coming about this time too so youre doing the roof doorbell rings we know who it is getting a new roof put on too well i got some problems with leakage in certain areas and just gotta get it fixed before we get the rain again alright well lets start in the kitchen okay this is this is one right here see i dont think you saw this one but im wondering if you dont have a floor plan of the house do you by any chance no we dont x we didnt get anything when we bought this baby im wondering if i should just sketch it out uh its twostory though right twostory th are there any registers on the second floor unhunh okay so all those s all those s that were behind us are the ones that go up through the wall oh okay well thats no problem uh as long as i dont have to do any ducting to the second floor yeah no they only the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones okay which are on the ground level how about that one right there is that one uh yeah thats one as well and then the return is back here okay good sized return yeah now youre not looking at uh adding air conditioning right well we would like to have that as an option x okay we could always add that later right yeah one of the things you can do if if you dont wanna do it now you can what they call prep for air conditioning you can put in the coil see youve got the furnace and the coil yeah and then when you add air conditioning in the future all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit and refrigerant piping to that coil so it saves it saves additional work in the future mhm otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in which means you gotta modify the duct work to get that coil in there so right if youre thinking about doing it in the future you might wanna at least put the coil in it only costs about threehundred fifty dollars for the coil oh alright its the its the out air conditioning that well write that in there anyway in the in the quote and now thats the the dining room you wanna add yeah if you if you go over and have a look at the dining room you got a lotta glass in that room it looks like yeah and uh were gonna be making changes to the to the house too so were keeping that in mind but if you notice there are no registers in here so is this accessible oh yeah i wonder i wonder if was this added on you think maybe im just wondering if that foun wall m it mightve been goes to that i wonder if i can get into this oh you can get into it yeah okay oh yeah ive been under here oh okay good so this is not a problem shoot id probab go with two registers in this room x alright x id probably go like one here oh yeah and one one there youd do one over there as well cause its a goodsized room with a lot of glass okay or you could do it you know you could put like one on this wall and one on that wall okay on the two two out and then id probably tie em both together yeah into one ybranch you know like the room mhm the room is shaped somewhat like this i could put like one there one there now what wed want you to do in this case is maybe tie those together like that see this this the end of this room might be modified so all we wanna know is is that we can eventually be able to do this alright to to get uh get this duct work done when we do when we do the modification to the oh so you may not do the duct work at this point not not in this room x xx do it in the future we m yeah uh i i hate to see us do it where are gonna be your although if we do it in the sidewalls well what would the modification be oh we might take this out and we might push this out further and uh well heres the drawings right here uh lets see thats the guest house where is that sucker dining room yeah yeah i its right i here it i here it i here it is right here is this the wall you can see that this is the current wall oh okay so are you gonna go out like three feet or so so we might we might we might uh do a little modification a tape tapered uh corners a tapered corner there so we might do a little of that okay but if youre gonna put it in h this end wall then maybe it wouldnt be affected that one might down there because we might uh yeah xx see well see eventually we have s you know youre right cause i cause were looking at right there course now you gonna go out thats right see were opening this thats gonna go that way that its that that thats going out to this master which is gonna go up on the hill aw so youll need what about heating for that well what were gonna do is put uh radiated heat okay in in there thatll be a slab floor then for sure yeah yeah uh so that one might change yeah uh i thats a thats a good point ive i im not uh we were th the only thing i i dont know how long is that gonna be like in the future like a year down the road yeah probably cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime i mean say you do the furnace it would be nice to have it for this winter well let me work that out with my wife put that as a but one thing you can do even if you do a modification you can move the register i mean say we put the register right h and thats gonna b uh that would obviously have to be moved you know its not a big deal to move it from here to here yeah you might have to add a piece of duct work but its not gonna be a major change okay okay and this one you may not have to move at all that may be okay alright but then thats probably how id do it some something like that or if i had the registers going that way that might be the best way to do it itd be like for fourteen by six i mean that would probably be an eightinch duct thatd be an eightinch thatd be a teninch and then the furnace i dont know its somewhere over there in that area furnace is im not sure how many feet well the furnace sits down over in this this corner over here thats where the furnace is one two probab right in here three and now thats probably what thats one of the thats about thirty key my key concerns about thirtysix feet across is th is the how noisy the furnace is thats a real concern to me a uh i dont know what theyve got these days if theyre all uh i know theres pulse type furnaces which evidently are kinda lou or something oh yeah yeah lennox pulse oh really thats a loud one is it yeah really ive put a few of those in and they have you ive had problems i wouldnt go with the lennox pulse okay if i go with a uh well id probably go with the carrier carrier furnace the return grills plenty big enough yeah its a big return i mean i cant you cant have any kind of problem there and a and and the pipes are big enough so and thats normally when you get you get a lot of noise in the house is if your if your uh ducts are too small right right yeah y the two main sources of noise are either uh air noise which is due to undersized grills really you got air rushing through there at high velocity the other source of noise is th is the fan motor itself in the in the actual in the unit itself unhunh and thats usually solved by b just having flexible duct between the unit and the d and the registers so that it dampens out the noise in other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall it would be noisy yeah but were going d im not sure how it connects did we see that down there ill have to go down and take a look at that again but okay i imagine it goes dow and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit as long as i can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit then i you can then i can uh eliminate th the noise problem alright so its basically thirty by thirty return air thirty by thirty return air and this is a uh this is the only return and id i would say not oh this is return also not placed not placed very well in the room this is so this is supply though right this is the supply right okay yeah see and id where would you suggest they would go if uh if we put uh boy i would say g id probably go with two id put one on each side id probably put one like right underneath that window there and maybe underneath that window be nice to put it behind the couch but then youve it would be blocked off too much and you thi you so you you p you try and put em under windows where thats where your yeah i try to put em on the cold x basically the coldest part of the room okay because uh it just helps y because otherwise you know with a grill right here you end up having cold spots on the sides mhm cause what happens is the air goes b to the return grill so it never really it wouldnt get out circulating through it never really blows out to the corners right so thats why i try to put it as far away on the perimeter and have it pull across the room okay well this is the on so i dont know if youd wanna uh the only the only other addition room where we thought maybe registers would be important and id i dont know if uh floor registers are there are th i i i is d does it thats not a good idea these days no i would go with floor registers in this house cause you got high ceilings uh xx well in fact you wouldnt be able to put any kind of ceiling register in cause you get the second floor right so no floor registers are fine for heating but th youre talking about wa regis putting em in the wall here no i was i was thinking about putting em in the floor oh in the floor yeah to to go in the wa would be pretty tough okay alright i dont know if you wanna cut the floor though yeah well i hate to do it right there may maybe wed do it right in here yeah but to get in the wall would be almost x i mean you can do that during new construction but its tough when youre coming back after the fact cause you just got sure your your twobyfour framing and its just too tough to get in there okay alright so wed put a couple in this room somewhere and then uh so this is like a family room is that what this is uh its kinda like a lo kinda a little parlor library something resembles alright xxx xxxx this is a register so thats okay cause its under there okay the bathroom has a register now that was it xxx how about the uh thermostat this guy okay i would definitely go with a new thermostat yeah kind of a x antique but thats probably a good thats probably a good spot isnt it yeah that should be in a museum uh i dont know i i are we doing the right if im supposed to kinda walk you around the house here is that what uh yeah do you think well i guess you havent really i dont know if theres anything you need to do up here other than the fact just kinda know that weve got em yeah you havent r really lived in the house during the winter have you no and thats what we th so you dont really know if theres a see and thats what we thought we would do uh so youre not really sure if theres any problems with heating certain areas thats right so i sa so we dont know if theres any particular areas like that b i bet you that parlor room has had a hard time in the past do you think its pretty cool in there just that one grill and then this guy has a register so oh they got ac up here too yeah i n i think thats gonna go well uh especially if you get the forced air heating and cooling well yes you wont need that one little guy there yeah see these arent strategically placed either but youve pretty much got no choice on most of these these its almost impossible to to change these now but really on the second floor this ones not too bad the heat the heats gonna rise from the first floor anyway yeah up to you know so i and itll hold it in here real well yeah typically and if anything you have uh overheating problems mm yeah on the second floor well see thats what we wanted to do is have some kind of a system that we know we can shut off certain certain areas like if w one of the things we could do i dont think they have any dampers here do they oh they do yeah so you can close off oh okay so thats how its yeah you can close off individual d close these off and then the then itll force the air what down into downstairs now x the one thing you dont wanna do though is close off too many of em cause then you put a strain on the cause cause then youre uh yeah youve gotta have a certain amount of air for the furnace to work properly and if you reduce the airflow too much then it wont have enough air going across the heat exchanger and itll itll overheat the heat exchanger oh really okay so i would say you dont want to close more than uh more than about twentyfive percent of em or you can close em y you know if you close em uh a a hundred percent if you close em all the way you probably dont want to shut more than twentyfive percent of em all the way which would b im not sure maybe all upstairs you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though unhunh just to make sure you get enough air yeah but okay so wed be looking at adding two two registers for that parlor room adding two to that parlor room and then what about that one do you wanna hold off on that well maybe we should jus or would you wanna do at least one of em uh i think we should do something yeah only because because if that remodels a year away then i i th i guess i th i think this thing is gonna be a cold little oh i can def see that i i i can tell you that because the windows see you only like the only heat you have in this room is that one register over there the windows in this thing are just a bout ready to fall out i mean theyre theyre not look at this so i know theres gonna be a lot of uh a lotta infiltration yeah until we get this corrected see hopefully youll go with doublepane glass on your remodel x thatll help cut down a lot yeah on your yeah heat loss so i mean uh in some ways having windows is it a bad idea because you get a lot of natural heat from the the s from sun thats right you know okay this is like it would get so this is like east facing right yeah the s in in so you get some morning sun you get the morning in the winter its gonna come right across like this yeah so xx so thats gonna be good so thatll be good so maybe one register in here for the moment until we kinda feel it out would be uh sure i mean this one it looks like if we put a register over here you wouldnt have to change it anyway yeah no that that with your remodel that might work into it yeah and like i say even i even if you do have to move it its not x a big deal i mean somebody just moves it okay you know a carpenter can do it even you dont even need to have us come out and do it really you might have to add a buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there but its not a yeah not a big deal okay alright okay well that sounds good well let me check downstairs again i gotta take some measurements on that room o well now you get youve got the logistics of every oh wait and then i think my wife now you now you say about my wife said she would like to have a register put in this room and i think its kinda weird but what do you think why would she what is this what is this room used for well even this is gonna be uh and were gonna open this up were gonna take out some of these shelves and get some light to come through here this is sort of like a pantry but kinda pantry area but its gonna be an extension of the kitchen kind of so i dont know if uh id yeah id put id probably put one like right there about right there you gonna be putting anything there i think probably somethings gonna go there right a table or something i dont know i yeah cause thats about the only spot you can put it well i mean y we could put a we could put a floor r floor register right along here i dont know if youd want that but thats probably where id put it in fact the one that i was gonna put in there id probably we might have trouble getting to this spot though i think you think so yeah cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end yeah well lets uh maybe on this end yeah it would have to be if anywhere itd have to be down x thats not a bad spot okay its gonna help out cause i see this whole area youve just got that one grill its a pretty goodsized area right here okay what about the kitchen well lets lets consider that kitchens got one kitchens got one right here yeah okay and uh im not too worried about the kitchen i dont like hot kitchens anyway cause i mean y you got a stove going and ah were in good shape that way ah wait a minute did i forget something else too ah yeah were gonna have to put a register out here because y this this wall is eventually gonna come out and so uh utility room utility room but its gonna eventually be part of the kitchen and were moving the utility room so and this t this is a joke n_look at this well some of these x maybe maybe this doesnt make any sense to well some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel like im th im im wa im beginning to won if because what i would prob what you can do uh is tap right off the plenum cause the furnace is somewhere in that general area its right there yeah and you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct and bring it to this room okay well thats what we wan to so that can be done thats what we wanna kn wanna know that can be done at a later time alright but maybe t that can be done at at any time maybe for the sake of your quotation really you should say this is what its gonna cost you to put in a duct here all these ducts at this time yeah okay now i dont know if if we can price em out individually or not sure i call this what utility r utility room yeah just pu uh call it a figure a duct somewhere on this wall you think yeah lets just assume itd be on this wall okay utility room kitchen that back one well call that pantry yeah pantry and then you got the dining room glass dining room glass dining room and then the par and then the parlor one on each end there yeah cause we can do em now or we can do em later but its not any more difficult to do em at a later time so its not like you ha to do it now okay so the registers that were connecting to that are existing how many of those we have got weve got the one in the kitchen and then weve got uh one in the d living room here that guy then theres one in the bathroom theres one in the s study and there is one in the library or in the parlor i dont know what wed do with that do we disconnect that if we put two or do you leave it uh yeah i might disconnect that well its not its not connected up right now so oh thats right so itd just be a matter w actually it sh it should be capped off probably though and this is the study one right there and the bathrooms got one bathrooms got one over by the shower there on the floor okay okay let me take a look downstairs again okay at that furnace this morning were gonna be looking in the book of exodus and weve been talking about uh vision and hearing from god i was trying to come up with a definition in fact i i looked it up in the encyclopedia for vision a there is definitely a definition several uh and i didnt really like any of them uh so i th id try to come up with one of my own jim larson was uh sharing a quote from yogi bara last night and i wanted to share that this morning he says you gotta be careful when you dont know where youre going because you might not get there which says so much that we need to know where were going and vision really has to do with having an idea of where youre going our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish our vision and heres the heres the definition i came up with you can write this down but uh uh dont use it unless you uh agree with it its mentally seeing where one hopes to be in a specific period of time its in your imagination in your hopes that youre looking ahead and h trying to see where you will be in a specific period period of time so our vision for the next few years our vision for uh the next ten years whatever uh what is our vision as a church planter pastor queen came having grown up here and having gone off to to school to seminary god brought him back to start a church and he began to seek gods uh vision for the church and through his own personal experience and through the scripture and god gave him a vision for a church that was committed to being a part of what god was doing a church that was invested in building the kingdom of god by caring for people where their needs were and by sharing the truth of the gospel of jesus christ our vision is is a direction of involvement toward a final destination when i started thinking about missions i thought immediately of the blues brothers you know and dan ackroyd comes out i forget what his character was but he says were on a mission from god and thats what the church is about were on a mission from god in fact let me clarify it a little more the church has been given a mission but our mission is not for us to go and decide what were gonna do our mission is to participate in an to carry out gods mission because you see go is on a mission gods mission is to build his kingdom to build the kingdom of god to bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love relationship with him through faith in his son jesus christ you know what if our vision does not include reaching lost people and caring for lost people then its not gods vision because the bible is very clear that go ca about lost people yes god loves people who dont have it all together yes god loves people who are hurting yes god loves people who are suffering who are seeking and if our vision as uptown baptist church doesnt include in fact if our vision as individual christians with a relationship with christ does not include reaching out and touching the lives of lost hurting dying people its not a vision from god because gods plan is and has always been to use his people to carry out his mission and were gonna see that as we look at moses beginning in the first chapter of moses im not gonna read i am gonna read some of it but im not gonna read all the way through because were gonna try to breeze through the first four chapters lets look how god was involved in moses or how god involved moses in his mission gary one of the things i want us to do uh on building beautiful day is build a taller podium write that on one of those sheets of paper back there we we need it about right here oops okay first thing were gonna see is that god prepares his servants for mission god prepares his servants for mission as we read in actually as we get to the second chapter well see that uh moses was not only preserved but he was prepared uh for his part in gods mission we have to go to chapter one to get a little background read with me in verse six of chapter one now joseph and all his brothers and a that generation died but the israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous so that the land was filled with them then a new king who did not know about joseph came to power in egypt look he said to his people the israelites have become much too numerous for us come we must deal shrewdly with them for or they will become even more numerous and if war breaks out will join our enemies fight against us and leave the country so they put the slave masters over them to oppress them and f with forced labor and they built python and ramses as store cities for pharaoh but the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread so the egyptians came to dread the israelites and worked them ruthlessly they made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with a kinds of work in the fields in all their hard labor the egyptians used them ruthlessly the king or the pharaoh was a little upset because the israelites who were their slaves who were their servants as they took a census they realized that the israelites n were catching up with their own of the egyptians and this was upsetting because he saw this as a national threat from his perspective they w they r you know he just knew that they were gonna grow to a number and they were gonna outnumber the egyptians and then they were just gonna take over you know if any other countries decided to attack uh and to to battle uh the egyptians that he just knew that the israelites were gonna join them and were gonna overthrow from the inside so the next part of the chapter he begins to you know first of all he b he works the men very hard he said man if i work these guys ha there not gonna be going home to their wives and there not gonna be uh having babies you know i guess that was part of his plan thats his first strategy so lets make it hard for them lets really work work em so that theyre too tired to go home and and uh procreate well use that word but that didnt work cause they st they continued to they continued they continued to d to uh have babies and they continued to multiply so he g devises another plan he goes to the midwives you know the israelites had midwives they didnt have doctors but they had uh women who when a when one of the israelite women were gonna have a baby then these midwives just come in and help in the labor process or in the birthing process and so he goes to the midwives and says listen heres what i want you to do you go and you go ahead and you do your part and you help these these mothers but if they have a boy i want you to make sure that that boy dies if its a girl you go ahead and let it live and that was his plan well the midwives you know what could they say this is the the pharaoh so they agreed to it but then they didnt do it because they feared god more than they did pharaoh and when uh he calls em he says whats going on theyre still multiplying theres still boys being born here what is going on the midwives said well these these mothers theyre having the babies without us you know theyre not telling us and theyre just going ahead and having em theyre s sturdy women it says they dont need us and so pharaoh comes up with another plan it ends up in the final verse of this chapter verse twentytwo then pharaoh gave this order to all his people every boy that is born must be you must throw into the nile but let every girl live so hes ordering his people to go and every boy that is born to the israelites to to kill em throw em in the river well moses was born about this time and this is how god preserved moses now mosess mother loved her child and she didnt want to throw him in i dont think any of the mothers did and she wasnt gonna do it herself and she was one of these that had the baby without telling anybody except her immediate family and moses already when he was born had an older sister and an older brother and the mother now when i was growing up and i heard this story i just assumed that the mother was hiding the baby in the reeds and thats where she was hiding him but it says for three months she hid the baby didnt say anything about the uh the in the river or in the in the uh basket uh but then when he was three months old she j she was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon and so she devised a plan and it doesnt say here that she devised a plan but believe me this mother knew what she was doing she b she m got a basket she perhaps made the basket probably did and then she put what they call pitch or tar uh on it so that it would float so that water wouldnt come up through it and she put a blanket put the baby in it wrapped the baby in it and she told she brought it down to the river now she didnt just go anywhere in the river she brought it to a specific place not just because there were reeds there but because the pharaohs daughter ba there and this was a selected place the mother took the baby put the baby put moses in the water and told her sister to keep an eye on it to keep an eye on him so that nothing bad happened but also there was an another motive that well get to in just a second so the w so moses was floating along in the water the pharaohs daughter came down to to take her bath and she sees the basket and she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her and she opens it up theres moses and he begins to cry and pharaohs daughter felt sorry for moses and she just decided to keep him it said she realized said this is an israelite baby aw aw poor thi and so she she decides to keep him we heres what pha uh mosess sister did that was her cue she comes out from hiding and says oh whatever your name is says oh mighty princess allow me to get a nurse for the baby i know of an israelite nurse that can take care of this baby guess who her mother so she goes and gets the mother now why do i think this is something that the mother knew about cause it ends up that the mother not only had her child to stay alive but she also got to take care of him and got paid for it so god not only spared his life but he provided uh for for that whole family but especially for moses so we see how god preserved moses we also see how god prepared moses because in the uh mosess life is kinda divided into three stages each being forty years the first forty years he was in egypt the second forty years he was a shepherd and the third forty years he was l the people out of israel and in this first forty years moses got the best training in the world at that time his foundational training came from his mother cause as the nanny and thats what she was at that point even though she was his mother she was his nanny she trained him in the foundations uh trained him taught him who he was taught him about his hebrew origin and the customs of the israel israelites taught him the foundational belief in the true god taught him of gods promise to abraham to multiply his descendants and make a mighty nation of them probably the first four or five years the bulk of his time was spent with his mother and he im sure she told him that that uh she was his mother his real mother and and about what had happened cause we wouldnt know about it uh if she didnt but not only did he get this religious training and this foundational belief in a r in a real god but he also was exposed to the best education that egypt had to offer exposed to the wisest teachers and the best culture offered in the world at that time he learned about the politics and customs of the courts of course this would help him later on when he had to come back and and uh and deal with the courts from a different perspective but that first forty years was spent in being trained and he was trained well and he had great knowledge a lot of knowledge that he was uh that god provided for him through these means and then for the next forty years he was exiled from egypt because in order to thinking that because he was an israelite by birth uh and seeing an israeli being abused uh he stepped in and he killed the egyptian that was abusing him thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved he buried him and then a few days later you know thinking well its its all cool nobody knows ill just go on he tries to help or tries to intervene between two other uh hebrew that were arguing amongst themself and and he tries to be a peacemaker and they say you know who made you judge w what about this you just killed the guy the other day uh and he realized that people knew and he realized if these if these men knew then probably pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon and so he left he fled he ran he went out into the wilderness after a few days of uh walking he comes upon a a scene where these two young ladies are herding their fathers sheep and uh some uh mean guys who knows i dont remember who it was but anyway they came up and tried to to uh take advantage of the two ladies trying to take care of the sheep and uh uh and i i assume they were trying to steal the sheep or trying to steal the women either way uh but moses intervened and he ran them off and saved their lives and saved their livestock and so they invited him to come with them to to their home and they told their father what had happened and he invited moses to stay with them moses ends up marrying uh one of the young ladies as ken shared with us the other day it was a a mixed marriage because these uh this family was black so for the next forty years he becomes a sheep herder for his fatherinlaw who was a a midian priest and during that forty years he he g gained some other training first of all he became an outdoorsman he became used to being out in the wilderness and thats gonna be important for him for his final forty years another thing hes is the area where he herded the sheep was a a huge area and uh he got to know the terrain he got to know his way around and that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years in that same area and it was important that he knew where there the w waterholes were and and where the dangerous areas were uh and so god prepared him god also has prepared us and is preparing us for h for our part in gods mission god is continually building character and i think this middle forty years for moses was a was a time where god really built character cause he no longer had everything he wanted uh at his fingertips uh he had to learn some things he had to learn he had to learn how to depend on god on this god that he had learned about from his mother and god is interested in building character in us as individuals in fact god is more concerned about our character than what we do and how we do it and so a lot of what we experience we get frustrated with but gods purpose is to build character within us and so when were trying to decide w which we should do or not do something that were tempted to do we need to remember that gods more concerned about our character and we should be obedient to him because thats how he builds our character i believe that god has created and preserved and prepared uptown baptist church to be involved in his mission to be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting to be an influence to the community of uptown for the kingdom of god to be a beacon of light for those who are lost and as our sign says on top to proclaim that christ died for our sins god has also created and prepared uptown baptist church to be a model for urban church missions to the world and that wasnt our reasoning we didnt set out to do the things we do so that we could be a model or so that we could get publicity but god has saw seen fit to use us in that way and this is not for our pride this is just a reality im amazed at how people from all over the world have have come to the city and theyve come to uptown baptist church because they heard about us somewhere else in another country or they read a book uh that talked about uptown baptist church god has crea also created an prepared you and me to be involved in his plan first of all hes called us each to a love relationship with him some of us have accepted that call and some are still struggling with it but still he wants to have a love relationship with each person that is in this room hes brought us together from many backgrounds many very different backgrounds to be a family a family of followers of christ a family to be involved in gods mission building the kingdom of god i was talking to greg on friday greg gey and he was sharing wi somehow we got in a conversation and he was saying something about he he really needed intellectual stimulation because he tended to be more intellectual and we were talking about why some people were intellectual and some werent and god just flashed in my mind and i said greg you know god created you to be intellectual so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals so that you could share with them on their level because go didnt create us for our purpose god created us for his purpose and thats something we have to keep in before us god has created us m us like we are allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced for his purpose and its for us to seek him and to know what his purpose is papa joe has been a a very strong influence in this community not because of his education his educations came from the streets and as he came to a relationship with jesus christ he came from a background that w had survi from the streets he was an alcoholic now w how why has god use him he wasnt educated he didnt go through special training its because god prepared him with the experience of his life so that he could reach out to other people who are going through the same experience so you cant say well i dont have an education or i dont i cant speak or i cant do this you have to know that whatever god has given you whatever experience that god has brought you through that he wants to use it to reach people for his kingdom the second thing i want us to know from this st story of moses is that god reveals his mission to his servants the first that god prepares his servants for his mission the second is that god reveals his mission to his servants we have to go to exodus three and see how god gets mosess attention apricot m sauce liver and onions mm you should get a philad cheese steak beth

hospital three times carolyn was so affected by or unaffected or what with asth bronchitis with bron and so how did carolyn react well i for some reason she said thanks a lo you know because she was so worried about jonathan oh sh uh like oh hes gonna go back again in words i said but and then she told her that she didnt outgrow it until she was five or something she did have what weare all going barb didnt outgrow it oh outgrow it she was fi or some mm oh so carolyn was really happy so yeah because c like oh this is great n so then i said but look at barb shes healthy now and carolyn looked at her and sort of looked away and i thought oh boy xxxx x xx ru way to go caro well isnt she healthy mhm i mean she uh s i know she ha um more or less she has something wrong with her gall gallbladder and heart trouble and oh yeah back problems she has heart trouble her she has an enlarged heart oh lots of people have tha oh go thats true yeah thats true and shed bad back and shes always always using nose spray maybe shes alw maybe shes addicted uh uh a semi hypochondriac maybe theres coke in it i think that thats closer to the truth maybe shes a hypo sherry yeah yeah i think youre righ oh oh i always ha get backaches cause she goes to the doctor a lo but it see to me oh really i think i get backaches because i mean some peoples b are built a certain way well bad posture and just dont take care of it well yeah im sure thats part of it you know and al because of the way you s no but i mean some people get backaches more than other people and be youre ta and the world is built for women who are about five five its and its and bec youre the bo is not its cause of the way my body is the human body no but doctor hensel told me that everybody gets backaches yeah because y the human bod backbone oh not the body but the back right is no built right for an animal to walk on two f oh i see its built for an animal to w on all f right right so if you were uh spent your whole life on your hands and knees you never get a backache thats basic actually that h when you have a backache hm really is to get down on your hands and knees and walk arou and crawl around mm oh not crou not all the way down though h hm it hurt but then your backs gets sway back no but n but uh th uh no if you but if youre mo it wont if you just s there it will oh well you know um you wanna but when youre moving you keep it you know kris nelson yeah well when i i asked when i went in with my arm you know cause i had tr so much trouble with my elbow and so while she was giving me the treatment one time i asked her about backs y know mhm and she said the l the newest theory is the opposite we they used to say that you lie flat oh i heard this one with your e with your knees up yeah so that it will curve this way so that it curves this way yeah she says now were having em do uh exercises the opposite arching where you l flat on your stomach yeah and you lift your shoulders up mm and then you keep doing it until you can have your hands totally straight and your hips on the i mean your arms totally straight oh yeah and your hips down hm so that youre curved way up right so i started doing that and believe it or not my backache went away real real ill tell bill cause that but i cant one night that he was so s when he first got sick and he couldnt he was w stooped over his back hurt so bad you have to you star out real mhm legs just a little bit were numb you know we put four pillows under his knees uh and that backache just about went away but you see thats always worked for me too but it comes ba hm now his didnt though well then thats what you you know different people have different ty ki well and it was probably just from being sick uh that caused it and he just needed to relax it i am conc and that helped him relax carolyn thinks shes got a kid infection oh my god carolyns al uh carolyns almost as bad as barb at being sick but she just has these little things that come every once in a while and theyre always serious why does she think she had a kidney in well shes got a pain at at her waist in the back on one side only and shes not going to the bathroom as often as she should even though shes drinking gallons of water shes gonna get fat if she does that water bloating no shes gonna get bloated its different than fat thats fat yes i know no it isnt the same thing looks like yeah but you can lose it real fast oh i know once its xxx so is she gonna go to the doctor and find out well she went yesterday and the doctor wasnt there but the physicians assistant looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spasm so they gave her some oh he uh uh he or she got a some pills for muscle spasms but it hasnt helped as of last night it hadnt its at her waist because they told marleen in the back well our kid are up under your ribs well the thats weird r i thought they were l r you know yeah thats what we always thought too i always thought they were down here yeah thats what we thought where but the pai can be just about you know oh yeah i sup th true you know pain can be just about any pl but they tol marleen had s wrong they told her they were uh and they said your kidneys are up really here oh thats weird hm hm i think theyre higher than i thought yeah yeah i know that cause i always thought they were just below your waist anyway yeah i did too but there are sh yeah all sorts of j in there anyhow kinda which we dont need yeah well she thought she had a bladder infection when she was at whidbey oh did she i didnt know that why did she have the opposite problem well its not exactly opposite but well theyre kinda related arent they but its just mo through her system but they did even do a urinalysis which i think is ridiculous when she went in yesterday s but will a urine sh kidneys sure will it show a kidney mal if theres an infection oh i didnt know it would i guess it would because they did that for bill they thought he had a kidney oh they did but they never figured out what he had he had had pneumonia eventually the second week he had pneumonia the first week he really he had a vi apparently just had a vi i uh oh i thought it or either that or the they didnt know what he had he had pneumonia yeah he eventually developed it is that the first time hes ever had pneumonia no hes had it before xx when he was real little he almost died of pneumonia oh when he was oh really hey about th so now bill and jonathan are a natural class right right oh i get it but he outgrew it when he was five too a little older than five when they quit going to lewiston every week to see his grandmother oh thats when he outgrew it he used to have asthma attacks every time theyd go to lewis oh thats a drag he must have liked her a lot hunh or was it the cl he doesnt re oh oh his mom said it was she said she they went every just about every weekend she hated going his mom which f g it was jacks mother mhm oh hmm thats but they had to go see her pretty ba but he outgrew it but uh i scared marleen cause that was one of her dads problems one of her dads problems what asthma oh seems like weve got every bad th there could be in our fami he had a lot of things though her dad i was talking to a gal at work karen bax karen berringer baxter whos gonna have a baby uh shes does she have any already hmm hm shes my age yeah i know i remember karen her hus the one that had i berr i know the gal no her sisters husband oh okay u but she said they did a u gluc tolerance test on her yeah and there isnt any diabetes in their family and she goes to doctor hensel and theres diabetes in our family and he never did one on me for either of the kids maybe they picked something up in a blood test somewhere there must be some oh that could be her but and she had gallbladder problems right before she got pregnant n well so it could be that theyre and then theres and theres such a thing as pregnancy diabe mhm where you dont have it any other time and she may have shown signs of that really and then i never heard of that m hm thats pr weird m could be she didnt say anything about that see i never had that but grandmom did when she was pregnant with me oh she did oh were you big when you were born seven thirteen oh so she didnt have one of those classic signs of diabetes nope y f usually dont on your f baby see but i did but your babies were late beth my babies none of my babies were late yeah but laura was still big even thats what moms hoping that it means it doesnt mean anything about having diabetes oh i know lau uh d laura is i mean laura was big any uh was big wouldve been big anyway even if she had been on time cause she was big from the very beginning yeah i mean i went in at twelve weeks and he said this is a big baby or twins right yeah so she was bill said t last night he said something about the next kid i says bill i dont want any more kids im kidded out he says he looks at me and he goes beth nothing ever flaps you i said y now thats not true he said you could have six kids and you would just be cal and cool uh and just be beth you go guess what bill youre wrong but now sun just about did it i wouldnt be beth i wouldnt be beth any what happened sunday oh i just about had it with anna and sharon and i told sharon what they were just what were th ey doing they were mostly sharon got on her bandwagon about missus jackson and i just about came un about who missus jackson jean jack oh i didnt hear anything about it xxxx n youd left oh it was later well t me a it cause i hadnt heard all of this she was saying that that that we were talking about um different students being held back for different reasons and that about children being put oh i was telling her about that one of your girls read at such a low level that really should have been and they said well why didnt they put her in remedial and i said well i dont know but she was in reme well i said for one thing they cant put em in remedial without the parents consent and the the who thi about that greg went through in the first part of second grade his first and she was so up because what happened what hap they wanted to test him for a reme class who greg gre yeah it isnt a reme class they wanted to test him its called resource room okay yeah i know re roo but whate just a re and sh wouldnt let em one well uh she never did anything about it but she was telling an they never tested him that missus jackson or they did dema he go into the resource room i said sharon thats not right i said she suggested he be tested for it thats two different things that was the first thing i said and then she was saying well she just didnt do greg any good you know and i just about i didnt i didnt b but i you know i told bill later i said greg learned more from missus jackson than he ever learned from missus meyer oh well probably becau he tried harder for her mhm you know and he really heres our lunch finally and he he made a complete sw not complete but hed im made a big improvement mhm mm the caesar salad with the ke hm that was mine okay he made the kebabs a little bit bigger than i regular and i made the salad a little bigger so we put em on separate plates oh wow and im gonna get full then hunh what a deal i had the c mm thank you thanks and is everything alright now look fi look de looks good okay great thank you so and that was mm that kind of i mean she was going bugged you and then she said she says well and if she missus jackson is still there when doug gets to second grade shes not gonna get her hands on him oh brother and i said greg doug would probably do wonderful in her class greg did w r finally did well well and for one thing it bothered me because anna takes ahold of something like that and doesnt let go and sharon doesnt even think about what shes saying she just starts y nyanyanyanya and i was just you should tell sharon that principals do not take kindly to parents telling em what room they want their kids in mm i thought b they oughta put doug in there just to show her mm sh probably just as well im not havi doug well she just i mean greg theres just the whole attitude that what what grade is doug in hes starting first next year in kinder this year hm hm but you know like she know so much about it you know i said probably that one day the the teacher and you both just had a bad day and it came off on yeah probably just as well i wasnt there oh i was i told bill i had several things i wanted to say and i probably wouldve if anna wouldntve been there but i watch myself a lot closer around her m this is good clam chowder but its not as good as uncle don made he made some oh after they had gone clamming one of those you know i dont think sharon wouldve said it if youdve been around she better not uncle don made it after you w yeah but they went clamming sur enough sherry it didnt taste real clammy really mhm hm yeah it wasnt all that good well it was good but it didnt yeah whats the use of hav clam chowder it wa didnt if it doesnt taste like clam because eviden fresh clams dont havent developed a real strong flavor yet hunh unh how do they get their flavor being canned or some i would think so oh hm and refrigerated mm just aging hm um hm oh i had a s soupspoon and didnt see it till just now

fellow living in new jersey in nineteen f uh i graduated in high school in nineteen fortyone i went to work in a steel mill and uh lo and behold th the big war came along mhm and i went to my father and in in these days you know kids always uh w as opposed to today mhm you always went to your parents and said i wanna do this oh yeah m m i i said to my father i said mhm hey look i wanna go in the army and be uh an army pilot mhm he absolutely was so incredibly upset i couldnt believe this because he he was horri well he had been yeah he had he had been in the uh in the three twe three twelfth infantry in the seventyeighth division ah up through the meuse and the uh m the rainbows then the argon and the whole trick and uh yeah he got wounded and and he w you know and he never told me much about this but i understood very clearly that me uh he signing my papers to join the army air corps mhm in nineteen f after pearl harbor was sort of out of the question so mhm and you were on eighteen xx or nine right w i was probably s maybe well you had to be twentyone xxx so anyway oh i see mm i f out a this merchant marine acadamy at kings point i see mhm so i went home to him and said one day hey i got this great deal pop i they will take me into this acadamy its sort of like west point and all this bullshit and theyll train me and blah blah blah and so he signed right well it turned out after the last dog was hung that that the highest casualties in the war were the merchant service in the merchant marine per capita yeah right but yeah he didnt know that so yeah no big deal yeah so any i sailed cant shoot back uh i sailed off to the war you just sail fast and never looked back uh un so you started in the in the in the merchants in the merchant marine hunh merchant sea oh yeah oh and and and and i stayed united states department of commerce i st i i stayed i stayed in the merchant navy u my first trip was around the world out to the middle east uh i came back i went to school for a few months i was involved in uh i was second mate in a ship at the uh in normandy we made twelve trips from southampton to uh the beaches until we were in a collision and then they sent us home patched us up sent us home and then i came back into italy and we went into the invasion of south france and we went across the uh the atlantic and pacific mhm and the war ended then and so i stayed in the merchant marines for another year or two and then i went to college at uh uh university of pennsylvania and then where my f went hm where my father was good good school went to school uh i didnt do terribly well there even though my uncle was a business manager an maybe that was part of the problem um i was more interested in in reliving my youth or living my youth and for the first time anyway right make a make a long story short sort of get a holding of it m when they posted the grades in fortynine i i immediately went to new york and shipped out as second mate on the african pilgrim and went to uh south africa on the af queen i with uh no the african pilgrim oh okay uh pilgrim i thought i thought you were there with the african queen actually was a two h wi y was a two hatched katharine hepburn y i it was a it was a story but she was a real ship a twohatch ship based in uh in in uh uh in um uh uh west africa so i sailed on her for a little while u and then in f fortynine i guess uh guy named near now let me stop you now yeah yeah yeah uh since youre of re yeah but n its primarily because i wanna know when you say you were sailing now what were you doing during these different phases of your sailing life da i was sailing second mate you were second mate then yeah i was second mate on the a pilgrim okay alright yeah yeah this is my first mate pf hi first mate uh hi can we get you a chair my dear no i just came out to see if you were st still going strong hes still alive and you are hes st uh and hes still xx so hes doing quite well actually im gonna go back in be its chilly alright uh you just didnt want to uh think he mightve fallen over the fence right right or just go over the fence in the co toppled over it right anyway i was sailing second mate in the pilgrim right um this was american south african lines mhm um and and uh in f i think it was i got sort of fussy with that the purser was a guy named bob heins he and i decided that well wed sort of wanna do something more adventuresome so we we jumped ship in uh new york paid off and we took a passage in the america and went to paris i stayed in paris for seven eight or nine months mhm my friend bob heins stayed for twenty years ah he he sort of got hooked on that he g he uh he under what was r hmm what was up and what was down right oh he ma over the and went to wor and he knew what was he figured it out he knew what the hell this world is all about he figured it out xx yeah yeah figured it out so uh i had a lot of interesting adventures there and finally when i ran out of money uh i wrote home to my family and said would you be kind enough to uh please send me a p ho and they did well ah i was then twentyfive years old so i um well i did what any r redblooded american boy would do i took it down to the a uh uh to the uh us lines and i cashed it right right so i s on that for another month or two mm you stayed for life and then i wrote home and said gee im i need another passage home an then somebody stole it they sent it sent it to me and this time when i went down to american expre to us lines and they said well theres a hold on this this can be o used for passage home i said oh ah smart fam oh so anyway i sailed home in the uh old isle de france uh got into new york there was my mother and father and and we popped in and it was things were a little tight and a little tensy went ho mhm my m grandma was there my mother was there we sat around the dinner table and n dinner was served and finally my mother said well tell me what did you do in a typical day in paris m made the most br move of my life uh i said and you s p pass the butter and th subjects never been brought up since right yeah i like that yeah i like that anyway uh very good very good yeah so that was fortyni fifty i went to work for grace lines in new york as a port captain mhm sailed in a couple of grace liners south uh korean war started i had the uh i decided well shit m as well join the war threw in my hat d uh uh when i came back from one of those uh trips from down to cartagena i found a big stack of navy orders right mhm so i went to this m what i thought was my friend um th this navy captain down at ah naval headquarters i said this is terribly awkward ive just been promoted from third mate to second mate and and could we uh possibly postpone these orders for a little bit my friend stood up behind his desk in his full f stripes and said lieu you are in the us navy now i said oh xxx no one ever explained that to me be and a wee later i was on my way out to korea yeah oo where you got promoted rea rapidly right well no i uh v finally uh i you know after a couple months i got promoted lieutenant and you know and that sort of thing but uh it was all mhm i lo the navy i rea did like the n mm it was just an exciting thing to do so how many years there i stayed in the us navy seventeen years and ten months and then i was f out because i failed a promotion to commander so but all that service time you put in thirtyfive or forty years or something like that well but im am p right m im on the re list for pay for twentythree years service twentythree yeah thats thats thats what i was trying to get at so after all this happened now is that be of world war two a the uh no its because of the f the way the navy worked a of uh mm so i went to this guy and uh and and i was a reasonably hotshot officer in the pentagon at the time and and i went to him and said hey how come this is happening and he said well theres happens to five guys like you because the way the law was written and we fixed it as of nineteen fiftyfour instead of saying you if you failed a promotion you re retire as of twenty years from your pay entry base date mine was fortynine uh they said what weve now said is you have to stay twenty years so i said fine so handshakes all around mhm then i went off and worked for a couple of companies and mhm uh my my success in life if i can say it is is is consists of two things skill and luck min primar luck ten perc ten percent and ninety percents the right mix xxxx m and uh so anyway yeah i uh struggled along and uh one damn thing another uh and then one day debby said were moving to santa fe and i said well now that was her s choice sounded like a n idea hunh oh yeah h man hmm it was a binary decision al i had no choice let me ask you a ve important question you know and this is one thats crucial yeah why did you put the extension on your fireplace oh yeah to keep the make the fireplace work extension in the fireplace no i didnt d i didnt put an exten on the fireplace he is he is a uh no you didnt he is a aer uh expert no on uh chimneys the fireplace is the way we found it oh okay yeah well you didnt do that then but somebody did before that no its its a little thing that sticks up above the roof yeah hm tom think that mine doesnt work as well as it should because it should be extended like yours he thinks it yeah that the no it should j we we havent done a thing with it it needs to be higher you see because you get a dow no uh on toms the outside of the house was exactly the way we found it the uh oh o yeah alright uh alright s thomas i tr so whoever was living there before thats the one who discovered they needed to do that alright now who was the guy there before you doctor green alright uh is he alive no poor old green shuff off oh uh oh my god to buffalo shuffled to buffalo i cant talk to him thomas yeah uh in fact quite a we no its see ive been trying youre probably right i think youre probably right ive been trying to tell him the reason that on very still nights when its co and everything else hell get a down in his fireplace and its because the co air builds up on the top of his roof and comes down this is what the judge does on his spare time the fire yeah yeah hes k yeah pushes hes actually quite an engineer pushes fireplaces i see well my ba is in construction work hes an electrical and uh oh hes an electrical and carpentry engineer i s okay mm now we did change a th on the outside of the house hes been xxx hmm no weve done a few tricks inside mhm hes pretty good at that stuff we built a garage but thats all yeah uh our fireplace draws very well by the way uh yeah well i would n i would think it would yeah uh see this is what ive been trying to tell hi with that extra s extra height but but see thomas likes the idea that it doesnt match in uh with the design with the area well we gotta we gotta call up jack eaker right right you remember you know eaker of course yeah ah you know what eakers doing right now no we k we have a f we weve b we belong to this uh we dont belong but we attend first church down here uh presbyterian

blah blah but nonethe mhm we got a new guy k named mason called up and said hey would you join and we had a nice conversation and he talked about jack eaker said wonderful he said we talked about n he said jack is reha a house like he did this one over by the mansion now governors mansion yeah h yeah i h i knew tha one point two million he wants to sell it for yeah mm mm i said to debby xx mm i think were gonna move up to the rogue ri mm by uh hope he does a little better job at some of the things like electri howd he do here hunh he did too much himself that he shouldve put in somebody elses hands oh yeah like he we had uh oh he did it a himself yeah we had to do a whole bunch of electrical o uh because he hadnt done it quite right and stuff but really oh you pulled the whole kitch out its s hunh yeah yeah mm mhm we found you know wiring that wasnt what it should have been but thats all right he was yeah hes a hes an enthusiastic amateur you know he worked he worked hard at it well i am too well hes no amateur thomas this is about the tenth house hes done you know x well s yeah xx d some peo are amateurs for a lo time yeah yeah yeah i know a bunch of em and they get paid

these goddam pf uh perennial flowers here or are they an which is which which is that doesnt grow next year annuals uh right oh god yeah right the annuals he had all these flowers around yeah he had the most beautiful looking place you ever didnt want to see um did he ever tell you why he put this fence between our house unhunh this this uh thing hes put up when we went on a to trip uh w he hed come over and we had a few drinks and we agreed along this common walk we were gonna put up fir trees and all this stuff uh and then uh we built the garage which m meets code and all that and jack was so upset about that when we came back from the trip we found hed built the fence and i said to debby i didnt even see the fence for three days she said what about that fence i said fence fence yeah you know me what fence and uh so i said gee whiz uh hunh uh uh s so wed found out that jack was f thought that that took away from the the aesthetic the aesthetics to have this gara and i said well gee whiz thats fine so thats why he threw up the fence and i said hey look were a within the code i first wanted to build the garage sort of with five feet from the property line and he made a big fuss about it so i looked it up and said well well make it uh fifteen what ever they want we moved a few fractions and it works fine dont you think the way it is hey look i have no pro at all looks x uh except polly can get right through it no look hey polly and i are pals polly has three things mhm he he well hes getting a little long in the tooth he cant hop the fence here yes yes she is but he

look oh thats wonderful guilt looks uh lisbeth mom it looks so good so good it looks lovely you know this family w on guilt the engine of this family is a little guilt motor that goes vroo vroo vroo i dont agree with you i t agree right i dont and were making you feel guilty i totally agree but what you totally agree with your what are we totally agree jennifer youre agreeing with your yes i agree she totally agreed with herself i totally agree with me boy if that isnt conceit n is thats why its not believable xxx i totally agree such a great statement fill in the box its like giving yourself a survey xxx right a with yours do you think youre a wonderful person yes check i totally a with my yeah do you think other peo are mis mhm yes check do you agree with me yes check shut up x we three were all alo living in m living sery theres there is a fine line my echo my echo my shadow my shadow and me and me there is a f line though between guilt and responsibility like youre feeling a respon towards people ah mm and the feeling of guilt to m yourself do things m right and i think tha line is really fuzzy but i think o talk to me the gui strings are t very hard that is the biggest crock of shit i have ever heard no its not o you and i have had a talk about this be you not an orphan no well i happen to think yes now tell me that guilt is a very massive part of this fami jenn w what happened xxx guilt for guilt no shes right to a certain extent bu this family i to a certain extent how do you i qualif bullshit we believe in gui b you dont think this fami uses guilt well i the trou is a li guilt goes a lo way lo way especially if youre jewish yeah do you think a you g feel a little bit guilty about the way youve treated us all these years of life oh what a cr now guilt works two way thats bullshit now ive been looking for the may sev new york oh please mother ive learned hm shes like out there youre liz liz are you in this convers or not youre outre mer i hear it i hear it hunh you hear it youre uh duh oh i think mom uh wait my gla i have m i have i just go without g on i need xx mom what heres the deal you guilt me and in response i guilt you straight back t in response uh to guilt thats now a verb thats like ta said today its a new verb xx to beguilt to to w uh got ill water you said ill water you ill water you cause shes gonna sprout you know but like sometimes what ill say to you is youll youll start guilting me and what ill do in response is ill say mom youre guilting me whereupon you immediately gilting thats putting a little coat of go on top isnt it gold yeah thats right thats right cor thats gil not guilting excuse me liz sort of like airplane and whats oh plane and plain thats it um mom yes oh and plain and plane oh maybe this is it um that thought whereupon you like develop guilt well i think what jennifer said is correct uh how do you separate responsibility from guilt well if you have no feeling of responsibility no amount of guilt will appear in your head exact ly guilt in in fact the distinction between guilt and responsibility is you must fee that you have responsibility that you have fai in order to feel guilt then you have i agree its a li bit like s and confession guilt you have guilt no but then somebody but but thats mhm mhm cant have one without the other thats exactly thats exactly right this thing is leaking there ca be somebody who makes you feel like you ha a responsibility liz this is moving in a case when that is not necess clear ah so guilt is not the issue ah the issue is a denial of responsibility no no no no you totally turned what i said around xxx where i set those theres an ac agent there who is making you feel responsible for something that you are not responsible for well how could then you dont responsi is n xxx to how you know youre responsible uh is no an ob phenomena jenn it i often when they have been defined unless youve signed a contract no when there have been defi responsibility right for exam okay in most human relationships there are no defi written in in in mono is a good example i uh what what wha are we talking about now no monogamy im just talking about why im trying to think about fami trying to make me feel guilty situations im tro talking about family sit im ta about like set cleaning up after yourself or doing things that you have clea defined as ru in this house that is correct as you respon oh excuse me is that bad as whose re as no no as your our wait i want to go back to this mono thing the individual person what is what is that no im just trying i was just trying to think of examples of what are assu but never assu but ne delineated good question and therefore if its assumed and not delineated does responsibility exist or not it does ah good so we have wait wait im losing except i responsi assu you lost half of us back xxx responsibility can be either assumed or asked like or expli certain there seem to be three categories theres no responsibility assumed xxx there i responsibility but its inarticulate or its articulate thats right two categories okay right so now we got were all together now and so when when there is so wait can you have g for all three for of responsibility should i get a black no no and im saying and she said that im still confu shes saying were not talk about guilt hes still confused about monogamy im sorry im du im sorry were w not talking about she says g oh were not talking about guilt were talking about responsibility and denial of responsibility and i said no were talking about somebody who m

mhm lets not start what what about the checkout counter then but thats responsibility you were about to you were about to correct my m so so on something a the checkout well i i think there is a uh you see what happened at the checkout counter what hap we wanna know mo says i pounced on her and all i did this is what i did i dont know what happened i went mo calm down and then no i didnt say it loud i just went like this i said y uh sh such a lie uh did i p you said s a i was uh i didnt see what happened in the checkout c what i do not pounce on you i was gonna offer an opinion a the d the d the disagreement there about the uh what was she doing there why you the trust the trust involved do you think that true any yeah yeah i do think thats true but it was not about jennifer it was about the lady right but i i happened to agree with jennifer because it reminds me of all these old people in the supermarket who are standing there going are you sure thats twenty one cents or twenty two cents its programmed into the computer i the lady spec said to ho off with putting things on the counter mo was getting a h was starting to h at the checkout counter there were so many objects going on the counter it was ma her crazy just so many ob and it was not cle for a little few minutes there wh was already rung in and what was not rung in and i did not want the lady to get confu and ring in items more than once so she and sh specifically said not to put everything on the counter okay well then i didnt i didnt know that yeah and so what happened starts putting everything on the cou no i w acts like im a child like im just throwing things on i was no no there was an order to how i was doing it it was yeah o at a time yeah but jennifer as one persons order is another persons mess no especial if you look in my bedroom m was starting to hyper about something that did not require a breakdown and i was trying to pat her on the shoulder ts uh it looks a bit and i said to her in the car and say it was o that this language just makes me angry this ex language x ts what does this have to do with guilt right right i dont know rich or mon what does it have to do with monogamy thats what i wan know yeah i wanna come back to the monogamy thing jenn that was a slip a slip where did that language of exaggeration come from uh you know what theres two sides to this as a joke uh cause its uh my disease and mimi fogarty is like the biggest perpetrator of it mimi fogarty you dont exagg oh sh d oh youre very cautious it seems to me but sometimes i do cause when im around other people i tend to talk like them well uh just like just little jokey things just like yeah but thats just with numbers and stuff jen thats how you m humor thats how you make humor yeah thats just hu j and lisbeth are hyper uh sensitive like i told you twenty ti to one anothers language so if jenni says xxx uh mo lisbeth hears a lot more into it than mom right and if m lisbeth says jenn jenn j hears uh paragraphs yeah sure so theres a long history here nine of that paragraph is guilt well that thats like leannes and then xx xx well have very short sentences xxxxxx the button that you gave me dont look at me in that tone of voice well write very short letters to one another did you have that with your mo though right the other times well thats a possibility no she didnt talk to her mom what ma what were you saying about me and you that button you gave me with thi like dont look at me in that tone of voice the to of the voi yeah like xx i dont really think its true no it came with the valley girls i think everythings ripe with with hidden meaning where it started start what that way of j speaking just like m like i dont feel like peo say that and i x jew said that in the nineteenth century uh ah just ex my what ti is it in the e annoying it just expressing what oh about half an hour since you last asked richard this is hot ten twenty five ten thirty if youre bored do something

until you kick us out cause they didnt really want to buy anything they just wan to look mhm and i said oka were closed out and so i was moving them like making them go o mhm an they were trying to be cute and say sweet things and to stay in yeah lots of student types yeah there are a lot but there are mostly families so in terms of being uh mhm umm and so kids said well are there any oth what times it eleven i said no its ten thirty its past our closing time actually an they said well are there any other that what are the other bookstores open in town now im like come on its ten thirty this is the latest thing op bes ice cream stores and bars mhm and some other guy came in i felt kinda bad but i guess im glad i said what i said theres some guy came in who n he looked like a student sort of a student type but ver nicely kept friendly looking and basically needed a place to stay because he ended up in town with twenty dollars and i mean couldnt get to amherst cause of no car and no buses and no hotels that were open and you mean buses werent running then et cetera hmm and he wanted to know if i knew anyone who would put him up and i referred him down to paul cause i just and then i felt like oh i want to mhm but at the same time i thought well thats a better thing and should we talk to john about mhm and i also just wasnt quite comfortable mhm but at the same time i would have been comfortable i think so i dont know je ne sais pas oh the other thing i found out i h was returning the book on uh cohousing uhuh and um pau an well first paul said oh i have this friend named sarah in hart in hartford and she has this place that deals with coop whats it coop initiatives mhm a um they s oo im sore oo she deals a lot with alternative kinda housing and cohousing and housing for the sake of people and stuff mhm so we were talking about that and then while we were talking about that um a lady came to buy something an sh s gave me the name of this other this amherst architect who s started two cohousing developments in this area hm it was just so funny to and uh jen and i put a note in the log mhm in the book checkout thing mhm by my the so i wrote down the name of the book to check it out and she put a note said oh neat ive got a friend whos in a cohousing place in denver in like colo s i think it was in denver uhuh so it was pretty wil uhuh i have to pee okay oh xx my shoes first im so tired so so so tired i didnt buy any books i couldnt decide what i wanted and then things just got too harried and i just didnt think it was the right time to buy a book mm we got more stuff for your da what kinda stuff umm computer access places like places you could plug into xx xx plug in to get email and stuff or aw and i also fiddled around and figured out how i can get things to print out two on a page oo s take up less paper unhunh you need a magnifying glass but no i think its okay in better li yeah we have to get a light y oo i have to go to the bathroom really bad here o take this back i gotta take my sock off be right back yes lighting is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house so it seems like a fairly basic one that we could address fairly easily uh i was thinking we should walk down sometime to h to the umm eeya eeya eeya to the lighting place down b mhm why dont you just go well because i wanna i wanna do things orderly sorry scott mhm i used the rest of the orange juice but i put the container back in the fridge so that we dont have to wash it you can just make more orange juice tomorrow okay so far the cheapest place i found in here is in portland oregon how much is it its like six dollars a month thats okay mm see the thing is this light its cute there m its no particularly practical there i mean light does come through there but if youre gonna sit there and read you need light next to it well would it work to put it on the other end it wouldnt be as it wouldnt be as aesthetically pleasing mhm right that radiator tilts mhm hm so i got to look at the cop of umm its dantes inferno mhm its a new translation with twenty different contemporary american poets got different cantos mhm and translated them and so its neat cause theres these poets that i like and theyve done translations mhm of these different of the different cantos or cantos or whatever toes and um they well its expensive its expensive but its hard cover and its nice and it matches kind of this bath book this scented bath book that i wanna get mhm and i wasnt pla i dont really nee it the divine i dont need either one i wasnt urgently planning on getting the divine comed the the inferno one but the way they look together is very nice those two books together so i was thinking its sort of an aesthetic thing that it would be nice to get them together at a time im gonna have a little vacation so i can sit in the bath and have my scented bath and then i could read mhm i do realize its a little bit far out it seems like theres danielle said we need to the alexandra stoddard book back uh they re i think they returned the one the creating a beautiful home one the one that i had that had the the blue and red writing oh uhuh its not there its not in our inventory anymore maybe it mean that uh maybe the paperbacks going out and so they wanted to give the hard ba cover back i dont know i was very disturbed uhoh i can always order another one if i need to is that a program youre reading hm hmmm guess it a it w just a list of uh places that offer emails for service and different things oh well thats good oh you know maybe if we could turn the spider plant around which one the one that just looks kinda decrepit that one yeah maybe we could i think it would probably do better if it got its babies trimmed off i mean can it wait i think we thought about doing that in the springtime then i thought wed replant them yeah but i think theres more babies than we need would yeah and weve got three new babies that i could replant but i havent already unhunh and that yeah the the other plant over there is has lots of babies oh i looked at orlando today the book yeah do you think you want to read that together that interest you at all unhunh cause if it if it really wouldnt if youre just saying that to make me happy then no i thi i didnt n yea im i think it probably would it seemed like it would be fun to read out loud and i dont wanna start it if were going to read it together i dont want to start it on my own i wonder if if it would be any less abstra than the yeah theres a lot mo conversa more theres a lot more in the book like the part where she falls on the ground could be easier to follow and says i am natures bride unhunh she also says several other things and theres also commentary from the narrator unhunh after that unhunh so i kinda like the movie better that way cause its gets the point across un simply so yeah theres more in it your basic account fro ne net is two hundred and fifty dollars a month thats a lot thats who s connects to well if youre smith its one thing use the internet if youre dad its another actually its the five colleges oh oh i wanted to call jenny but it xx i

that over on the xx i have to send them money by the eighteenth for sa for the october exam put it on that railing over there okay mm so id better get twelve hundred on these have to get twelve hundred well if you study hard you cant study for the sat get your rest uh n but you well the say yes you can because they have all these groups that say that if you take their classes and they go over the test no mom mom mom you can raise your points you can raise your points a couple hundred points the sat the s board itself has said yeah yeah but thats just by learning tricks i know what the tricks are thats all you need to know teach them to me the only way you can but what you have to reme i that the only way you can score high is if you read a lot thats all what you have to remember is you cant study x that the sat is not a whole measure of who you are oh i know it doesnt measure your creativity it doesnt measure you know so mom i know mom im not saying that but i do need to have a better sat score for applications so i wanna bring it u whatd you say your score was ten seventy id be happy to get seven hundred well youd only taken it once so yeah i think claire took hers a couple times what i said id be happy to get seven hundred i i mean yeah people in my school when i told em my score were like oh you wont need to take it again but then like my friends who have like thirteen fifty on their s whos that but stephanie yeah but i mean you can you cant compare yourself you cannot compare yourself you are unique you mar xxx you cant do tha jo glen glen got s what glen got f s or something like that stephanie you cannot com i was like you make me sick stephanie but dont you be like glen is you cant compare your i know glen has to like get dates through the computer how do you think i feel when i get a gle when you learn that you cant compare youll really be grown up you are unique you no i mean you are not like anybody else i but mom you have to accept that the reason i am saying i need to bring them up and the fact that other people have higher scores is that i do need to bring them up from ten seventy if i wanna have a better chance at getting into colleges wheres your bathroom at right around the bend its not all they look at though or upstairs one or the other yes but its one of the thing that a lot of college use ill find one right around the bend well you know or you can go up if you want erika just uh well with all those guys sitting there well its on i cant x i should look around and see what else is go up to the top of the stairs go straight ahead what else is there and youll see it on the right okay theres a good see how about this school called a college in michigan xxx yeah its real its in adrian michigan not very far from uh ann arbor they sent you a lotta information sounds like a neat school but they dont ha a lot of its a smaller school i had a really good book that i should give you they dont have that many majors mom i wanna go to a school that has a large variety of majors and so if i change i have something to look at you have to remember one thing hm and and i dont know maybe maybe gail could talk about that ou had a good art department gail went to a big school a big school was very different than a small school now aunt maureen went to a smaller schoo mo i want well th bo now wait they both have advantages and disadvantages both of them you have to see which ones fits your person best oh i know but mom thats it of my personality even clai said that she thinks i would do fi at a bi dont take claire as an authority im not taking her as an autho ah believe me ive lived with clai im just say that but mom if i wanna go to a big school thats my choice if im willing to pay for it yes its cheaper to go to a university than it is to go to a private school mom depends where you feel comfortable uh i have a platter when you get on a campus sometimes i think it might you can get a platter for that its gail might say yeah you have to go you have to go out and visit and then you feel like hey i like this place i think i could belong or you think i dont i dont feel comfortable here i dont feel comfortable here and thats what has to be your final goal oh yeah i know that a place that has what you want but you feel good a it but you walk on campus and you think hey theres something about this place ill dump this outside that that speaks to me i had one college that did that you know you dont know that until youre on the cam i had a college that did that mm but i would nev i cant get in cause its just too impossible duke univers yeah duke yeah i fell in love with that school right away but well you can always apply apply thats true abso yeah but i dont know if im gonna bother cause its like a seventy five dollar application fee and the chances of me getting in there are like zilch so what what do they require ih the people that i have met that have gotten in had four point o uh fourteen hundred on their sats and uh well kiddo you had a chance to study you know i mean thats basically they they were in like kept telling her the three clubs like the young republicans comes you know when it comes down to the you know uh some uh like business management and something else x uh uh past performance has something to say about that you know but stephanie ive been telling you for four years youve gotta work hard mom mom mo gail under i dont wanna hear it good old bu good old bu didnt want me no bc xx bc they didnt want her they didnt want me she snowed the interviewer but they still didnt want her you snowed the interviewer the interviewer was s goodlooking ha ha i lo it he was this young attorney he was real young and i had my interview in the us steel building and i went up there and but you know what they asked me some really weird questions though i know i know they did like they i expected to go in there and talk about you know my li and what i wanted out of a schoo and what i expected from the and so what did they ask you they asked me what my stance was abou on abortion boy that was a dumb question thats one boom i was like thats a contro question so i would think thats a dumb one to ask well its contro well they asked me that a they asked me and personal how i thought about drug testing in the workplace its very personal very personal those are both personal question you know what williams did the s well you know whats funny is you know bc is a catholic schoo yeah and i th you know i dont think they really liked my answ but uh thats but you have well but you still have freedom of choice you know what thats right yeah i mean xx williams is the same way cause lee went and lee applied to williams and she got waitlisted and williams used to be real lib liberal whatever but lately the information theyre sending out is a ni value community uh moral stance dadadadada i mean theres nothing wrong with that well no but what theyre do thats important but but m mom what im saying is im listening they had years ago they had the sitins everything you know real liberal now theyre going to conservative and when she was interviewed for it they took her answers very slowly and they waitlisted her she had the grades but she didnt have the political views and uh thats what was happening so maybe she was better to be in a place where shes free to express herself oh yeah rice rice is great she you know rice is really liberal xx x xx x things work out some for the best as maybe gail realizes too you know oh shes much happier at yeah shes

couldnt breathe through his nose at mm and then he couldnt even breathe he had um they had this thing it was this big old long old tube here and it was funny cause like we could they put a mist child youre having problems and you could j see like smoke you know like a mist like a humidifier coming out and i was like mhm mhm and i was all out of his throat i mean then whered they put this on in where did it no they stuck it in a tu it came out of a tube and i just had to hold it like around his face oh oh okay okay so that he could come here it was oxygen but they put a mist in it so that he could they didnt want to stick uh oxygen tube up his nose or put a mask on him cause hed take it off mhm and it was funny because every time like hed see a person wearing blue hed be all and hed start like not breathing oh and then hed like poor and then it would sto and theyd be all okay okay and theyd walk out of the room cause they didnt want to excite him cause they didnt want him to hyperventilate poor thi xxx yeah hes doing better and then the doctor comes in and he just looks at him and then they stick this fing thing on his finger its like light sensored and they have to guard it from the light and thats what measures his heart rate and it measures his oxygen percent how much oxygen hes getting wild cool it was weird and he was all in did his oxygen get low or yeah it was like eightysix percent yeah which of whats supposed to be like ninety what a hundred u adults are probably like ninety okay i think adults are supposed to be anywhere from like ninetythree to on up x you gonna go down but anything and you ha ba higher or lower yeah gonna go on the floo babies are usually higher because you know they uh are you mad at nina they havent been around as lo so she yeah

sixtyeight versus two o four thats still scary and hed just do uh he was doing it when hed get really excited so thats why they were staying away from him and uh we had to hold him down for them to give him a shot in his thigh a shot whyd they give him a shot to make the swelling go down in his throat oh did he get it in his bottom n right here in his thigh how is he about shots he cries

oops so uh sharon didnt get to see her mother okay folks were coming to a short stairway use the handrails and be careful please okay folks lets find out where we are we got on the elevator right here came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant down that stairway out on the power plant ramp about that far then right at that yellow line and youre now standing over the secondlargest water pipe in the world and its called a penstock more about that a little bit later the colorado river flows in this direction in order to build a dam here the very first thing they had to do was to get rid of that river so they came up here above where the dam was to be built and drilled and blasted out four diversion tunnels two on either si into the canyon wall around where the dam was to be built out in the river down below each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fiftysix feet in diameter and then lined with three feet of concrete youre now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels they then came up here and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high to force this river into these diversion tunnels came back down here built the other part of that cofferda about sixtyfive feet high to keep this water from backing into the work area they now had from he to here where they could build a dam they pumped the water out of this area and excavated down another hundred and thirtyfive feet to bedrock okay folks if you will please take a look at this picture taken during construction looks like a series of boxes or blocks stacked one on top of the other and those are wooden concrete fo each one of those forms are exactly five feet high but they did vary in area somewhat because they did not build the dam right straight across the river from canyon wall to canyon wa they built it in the form of an arc and its called an arch gravity design dam where the force of the water coming down the colorado river hits the face of the dam and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wa its a very strong design they did build two concrete mixing plants here they did pour concrete for twentyfour hours a day seven days a week three hundred and sixtyfive days a year for two years less six days now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eightcubicyard bucketloads eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms the smallest of which is twentytwo by twentyfive feet only filled that form up about three or four inches deep so there goes that story you may have hea that there are workers buried in the concrete here couldnt possibly happen but what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete was oneinch steel water pipe they came down here in this lower cofferda and they built an i plant capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day they used that ice to chill the water that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete as concrete ha or cures as we call it it produces heat the more you can control that heat the better job of curing youre going to get so they used the chilled water method of taking that cold water forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete picking up some of that heat then carrying that heat out and away they felt if they did not use a method such as this that it wouldve taken approximately one hundred and fifty years for the concrete in the interior part of the dam to cool down so the system did work and then it hardened and they remove these wooden forms they left voids vertically and horizontally these forms came together those voids were filled with grout under high pressure grout being a mixture of concrete and water when this is done you have what we call a modified monolithic pour or basically a solid block of concrete which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base fourtyfive feet across the top twelve hundred and fourtyfour feet from wingtip to wingtip seven hundred and twentysix point four feet high six point six million tons of concrete thats enough concrete to build a twolane highway from new york city to san francisco o put another way a fourfoot wide sidewalk from the north pole to the south pole then they had to protect that concrete a little bit the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways as you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon you may have noticed those spillways here they are one on either side what they did is they came in here and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here closed these gates up here now this yellow part is forever under water underneath that lake out there and completely useless but they did incorporate into the design of the dam the balance of those diversion tunnels using these outer two as spillway tunnels now these spillways were built so that the top of the spi is twentyseven feet lower than the top of the dam this assures us that n any excess water coming down the colorado river rather than overtopping the dam overtops these spillways on either side goes into the canyon wall around the dam out in the river down below each one of these spillways is capable of handling two hundred th cubic feet per second of water thats the same amount of water that goes over niagara falls falls three times higher than niagara falls does time that water reaches this area down in here it is flowing at between one hundred and one hundred and twenty miles an hour okay we have protected the spillways now they had to get some water uh into the power plant what they did is they built four intake towers two on either side of the river on ledges above the river each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake are three hundred and ninetyfive feet high each with twoelevenbythirtytwofoot gates in them one gate near the bottom one about half way up to let the water in the water then coming into the penstocks like the one were standing over right now this penstock you can see on either side of us out here is three stories high or thirty feet in diameter made of twoandthreequarterinch steel boilerplate made in section twentytwo feet long each section weighing approximately a hundred and fifty tons each of these twentytwofoot sections is joined to the next section using pressure pins like thi the water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon approximately two hundred and thirtyfour pounds per square inch okay we have the water this far now we divert that into thirteenfoot penstocks or water pipes each one of em going to a turbine the force of the water turns the turbine which turns the rotor in the generator and generates power the water then coming on the tailrace we saw it up there and going on downstream to be used at least six more times before it reaches the mexican border to generate more power good clean reusable nonpolluting source of energy the cost of the project a hundred and seventyfive million dollars i say project because that includes the building of the dam the building of boulder city about seven miles up the road the highway and the railway from las vegas out here to the dam site and in southern california they built the allamerican canal which takes water to the people and the crops of the imperial and coachella valleys this money was borrowed on a fiftyyear term at threepercent interest and was paid off in fu in nineteen eightyseven the people who worked here and they did work twentyfour hours a day average twentyfourhour work force was about thirtyfive hundred men the most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete fourtythree hundred men the laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator at a dollar and a qu an hour out of each mans paycheck the contractor did deduct each day a dollar and sixty cents because the contractor was feeding and housing the men in boulder city and taking them back and forth out here to the job site they did have ninetysix industrial deaths the biggest single category of death was classified as falling material basically falling rock but they did have some killed by explosion some by drowning some by electrocution and other types of accidents you might expect to have on a job of this magnitude they did complete the project two years ahead of schedule and under budget started in early nineteen thirtyone completed in late nineteen thirtyfive just twelve days short of five years do i have any questions whats this overhead pipe here x the overhead pipe thats the fresh air pipe in the summerti the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees so they bring that fresh air i and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam the water in that sump is a constant fiftythree degrees it cools that air down to between sixtyeight and seventytwo degrees then they force it back throughout the dam so its airconditioning without refrigeration like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler any other questions yes u during the uh earthquake this morning do you have any sensors down here that measure any kind of movement o str right yes w v we have several things first place we have three seismographs throughout the dam we recorded those but nobody down here felt em but we do have sensors built right into the concrete any movement that concrete makes is measured and recorded and they had very little of it this morning very little any other questions how far are you sending electricity california okay fiftysix percent of our power goes to southern california twentyfive percent of it stays in nevada nineteen percent of it goes to arizona what the government did is they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty to allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed california was growing very fast at that time so they asked for and got most of the power but by the same token las vegas about thirtyfive miles up the road here at that time was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad no hotels no casinos we asked las vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here and they agreed to do that but thats all they get today because that contract is good through the year twoth and seventeen so all those lights you see burning up there in las vegas comes from power from steam plants owned and operated by nevada power company using fossil fue they get very little of our hydroelectric power okay folks you can follow me now im gonna lead us out of here o here we go folks quite amazing y yes its a fantastic job they did down here yeah about how many people are employed here now right now theres about two hundred that includes the security people the guide force the nursing staff the people that run the computer room the office force as well as the people that work on the dam and thats a twentyfourhour figure but that figure is becoming smaller every year because every year we are becoming more highly computerized okay folks theres a tour group coming in stay to your right please stay to your right stay to your right folks tour group coming out okay if you would right up this stairway when you get on the balcony wait for me on the blue couches on the balcony please anybody needs the elevator its available anybody that needs the elevator its is available come on come on then up the stairway if you can x up the stairway thats up the stairs o here we go hi that was the turbine over here off to the si yeah thats the turbine runner you bet thats a computer design made of stainless steel its designed in such a way theres one of em running at a hundred and eighty rpm it actually l that eight hundred tons up a quarter of an inch for your main thrust bearing is the very top of this u structure right down here this is the rotor the rotor and the runner have come out of our aseven generator what happened we lost a water seal down there so we had to pull those out to fix that water seal theyll be replaced within a couple of weeks now oh i see that rotor in that part of the shaft weighs five hundred and eighty tons okay folks if you will please follow me now hey x h you doing good okay folks while were waiting for the elevators does anybody have any questions how long have you been doing these tours about five years about five years ive retired twice cant stand retirement so come back to work at a fun job oh anybody have any questions yeah ben water comes down the center of the where your shaft is goes out the turbine no goes around the dam water comes into those towers goes around the dam comes in from the side each individual turbine yeah the water drops in the center where the shaft goes in then goes down no no no it comes into what they c it comes in that thirteenfoot pipe goes into what they call the area of the wicket gate and there and theres a pipe around that wicket gate a that pipe goes from a thirteenfoot diameter down to a threefoot diameter goes around that wicket gate okay right it picks up speed by the time it enters that ap uh goes out that aperture that threefoot aperture its traveling at fiftyseven miles an hour but thats what drives that big turbine it goes arou the shaft it doesnt go into the shaft area at all the wicket gate uh all the water goes in through the wicket gate its coming in underneath yeah the wick perpendicular uh th uh well perpendicular to the shaft and uh uh yeah the generators sitting on top a i okay the shaft is like this and waters coming in like thi right thats what i thought and then it goes ar like this oh yeah and then out now that thing we saw down laying that uh alongsi okay with the uh looked like a thats a uh thats a r turbine runner we call turbine runner that and thats is that is that kicked up on the side like that the water no it just lays it spinning it around oh you mean the one d on the floor down there yeah yeah no thats lay flat like this x and the water drives that around this way like this oh youre right xx and drives the tur up there yeah and thats down inside the uh in the turbine thats way down yeah way down in the turbine so its in the turbine and thats the unhunh yeah thats whats generat yeah thats whats turning the wheel right right we were right on that right okay folks step right in the elevator please right on in step right in the elevator three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen nineteen twenty alright are you with them okay okay i saved room for you all right thanks a lot man you bet folks this does conclude your tour of the dam hope you enjoyed it as much as i enjoying have you come back and see us again have any questions on the way up ask norm byebye folks okay any more questions folks whats the story with this tile wasnt this created by somebody yeah folks the dam was built as a tourist attraction as well as being very functional this terrazzo flooring you see terrazzo is marble chips put down in concrete ground down and polished this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one it family by the name of martina okay theres two and threequarter acres of this uh t uh terrazzo flooring in the floor but the designs you see is what that italian family saw uh and interpretated from southwest indian blankets and pottery thats where the designs came from any other questions are there just two elevators down from these two shafts thatll take you to xx thats right two elevators down mhm the rest of its just solid right well there are there are two miles of uh tunnels going this way across the dam they have a pipe gallery they have a drainage gallery they have a a uh cable gallery and they have an instrumentation gallery and all those things are they measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery yall open seven days a week yeah mhm is it unusual to to do the generator uh room floor in something like this theres just yeah it its in fact it was built during the depression and they wanted to make it a tourist attra make it make it worth talking it was at that time the largest dam in the world they wanted to make it very nice yeah its unusual usually you just have con deck yeah i would yeah yeah yeah any other questions folks yes what are the chances of a leak hm what are the chances of a leak well uh it leaks all the time you see concretes porous and because concretes porous theres water coming through at all times but thats good because if therere no moisture in concrete it dries out an spalls and chips an turns to powder wouldnt make a very good dam so as long as that lake is back there forcing that water through the concrete at all times it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green green concretes very strong so we have a good strong dam say ben yes whats going on up on the hill up here dont think its uh okay thats a fivestory parking garage and the new building is a new visitors center the fivestory parking garage will hold fourhundred and fifty cars okay the new f visitors center will have three revolving theaters in it itll have a seating area for people going on tour itll have a museum the top deck of that building will be an observation platform we can look back at the dam in one direction downstream in the other now when thats all done they hope to be able to f to handle between one point two and one point three million people a year last year we had seven hundred and twentynine thousand eight hundred and eightynine people go through the dam but we had to turn people away almost every night just not enough time in the day to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it hmm will it have any slot machines in it no but itd be a good idea wouldnt it pay for this place whens comple on that parking garage they figure between fifteen and seventeen months yeah okay folks step right in the elevator please r on in everyone please fa the front of the car its gonna be seventeen m months seventeen more months everyone face the front of the car please ri to there front of the car please have they ever had to use the spillway just a minute okay folks this does conclude your tour of the dam i hope you enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed having you come back and see us again have any questions on the way up ask norm byebye folks thanks ben have they ever had to use the spillway okay folks the question is did they ever have to use the spillway yes just once in the history of the dam and that was nineteen eightythree what happened that year is they had a very heavy snowpack in the rocky mountains and that was followed by rain and hot weather which created a flooding condition we had more water coming down the colorado river system than they could put through the power plant every reservoir in the colorado river system was full to overflowing that year on july second water overtopped our spillways out here six days later it was going over four and a half feet high and that went on for sixtysix days at the end of that time there was no damage to the dam or to the power plant but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage but no loss of life but that floods what left that white line around the lake out there that white line indicates it was going over the spillways four and a half feet above floodstage it gives a false impression and makes it look like the lake of the level is low or level the lake of the low actually were eight feet above normal for this time of year wow yeah we had a very good snowpack last year u first of all maybe you guys can tell me we talked a little bit about it last time you were here or did we not talk about the history of the penguins thanks i wasnt here that weekend no no okay we talked about the endangered spe okay we have on exhibit now about twentyfi of the thi penguin chicks wow that you have um oops last year i s want to say around christmas time we went down the shed aquarium as well as other researchers and scientists went down to antarctica to collect mm gentu penguin eggs okay so i want to go into a little bit about the history of the gentus he um for you for don and lori where where did our original gentu penguins come from uh faulklands wasnt it where did the but specifi oh spe in the islands where did we get them for display here at the shed aquar oh from the um was it edinburgh uh zoo yeah great yeah in s yeah right okay are those the ones that dont like people the handsoff ones h one that came from wheres ten from there or is that oh okay yeah well is whats the other species rockhoppers the no magella mag xxx yeah okay ra magellanics came from the john ball zoo in grand rapids michigan mhm so the gentu which i take it you work mammals as well yeah okay so feel free to add in i worked with the baby penguins when cause ive only worked like a weekend but both days were spent with the penguins feeding the baby penguins and then ten and all of them great great so feel free after ive go through this information you know xx sha any inf you might ha mhm well ill probably have a lot of ques for you from your experien okay cause thats uh you know mhm usually the best way that we can get some good d information is from volunteers that actually work uh in mammals so we love that um anyway so we got the penguins our original batch of penguins from from this zoo in scotland uh and um you know as you know you ship them o and they go into a quaranti period and i do believe it was thirty day dont dont its in my literature right there ill check for certain uh that is required by the usda basically theres theres a disease called n newcastles disease that is is very uh contagious apparently and so theres always the potential o when you bring a bi o contamidate contaminating the poultry mm business okay and so that is th background information for the reason for quarantining u with our uh other penguins uh we brought them over from scotland a as it turned ou in a quarantine period that they had that a vi or i should say a fungus okay this aspergillosis fungus had come to f and we had lost you know a good portion of penguins s wow okay now its time to consider replacing these penguins how do we want to go about doing that well really didnt want to go through transporting the birds didnt work last time a potential for bringing over diseases is obviously there so the thought was okay lets get some e u sea world san diego has gentu a apparently just not enough eggs to share if they had them they would gladly sa situation with the edinburgh zoo they would gladly send us bi but they didnt feel that they had enough eggs to send over so we really didnt want to go the bird route and so that left us the choice of going down to antarctica and collecting some peng some penguin eggs ourselves so they we to and i dont know if this is pronounced correctly wiencke islan y thats whe a lot of seals are from as well hm okay mhm cool mhm cool thatll fit in with your class i know yeah nicole is here hi nicole hi hey let me how you doing can i just inter for one minute oh okay can i see your id mine i dont think dar put anything on it mhm right okay why dont you have a seat sure oh im tired so they went to wiencke island where a lot of seals are from a mhm xxxx x collect e mhm okay so the process wa im just gonna finish up on my story the process was was they um they went to the nest okay from our staff it was mark ryan from marine mammals and mike mulligan from fishes and frankly i im not quite sure who the entourage of other people we but they went to the nest and basically waited for the penguin to stand up and checked to see if there were two e the hm gentu penguins and this isn isnt true of all penguins often when a penguin lays e if it lays two one is smaller than the other gentus lay two equally sized eggs okay u hm the reason i mentioned that was if one was smaller he would have went for the smaller egg okay why becau that would probably mean that female do you remember rea in the exhibit for the rockhopper penguins downstairs they lay two dif sized eggs mhm depending on the year and depending on the conditions of light um if its a bad year or theres just not a lot of food resource um environmental conditions are rough its a stormy bad year mhm a penguin might lay two e and at that point i dont i dont really wanna use the word deci mhm thats kind of anthropomorphic but somehow figure out at this point im gonna kick out an egg determine ah m im going to determine through whatever mm h it does determine to do so hm will kick out an e otherwise it will brood the two eggs and hatch em out its not uncommon that at this point theyll kick out the smaller chick right if at that point conditions dont seem to be sufficient to support raising two of em its kind of like hey why bother mhm and kick out one of one of the chicks if its a great yea on fat theres foo di its a beautiful day its called penguin euthana okay theyll theyll theyll try to raise both so i didnt catch that what wa its called penguin euthanas sh ch yeah um so anyway apparently what th what they now at this point they wanted to see okay now is there actually a fertile is there a fertile chick or develop chick inside mhm and apparently it was very very muddy it was abnormally warm and it was just a big mudbath out there and they couldnt they couldnt clean off the mud enough to be able to see inside to see if if it was viable so they took an egg from nests that had two eggs and i think this this report says within thirtyone hours the eggs were back here in chicago wow thats pret nea oh and the the took them to an offsite incubation area in addison is anybody from addison i dont know where addison is i dont either s its a we suburb west yes so they were out in the west suburbs and incu there mm a nd apparently now theyre about s to seven weeks old wow when i was here two weeks ago they were sixty days t s two weeks ago it was six days i think maybe it was four weeks ago okay yea i think i think theyre around six weeks old mm okay but when you see them youll see that theyre just about as big as number ten theyre big n yeah when i yeah when i was here they had they were losing all of their hair and they looked the two oldest ones looked like ten right right so basically what the process has been is we brought them here as chicks but they still had their downy feathers okay so as they lost their downy feathers they became eligible to go out onto exhibit and so what they did last time you guys were here there was maybe te that were you know i say eligible to be out on ex and what they would do is they would carry them i let them hang out for about a half an hour get acclimated to what was going on and then take them o and do this now theyre out now theyre they are out on exhibit all of them uh almost all of em two days ago there was twentyfive out on exhibit so we have thir chicks total right hm so twentyfive plu are out on exhibit okay u thing of it is is lets think a little bit about penguin natural history okay how how long do penguins spe on land three months i think whats your guess uh three or is it three to six months okay u four five six six okay six months so its its ba wow its an even even spli be life out at sea and life on land so the sequence of events i they come on to shore springtime they hook up with their mate they build a nest they mate they lay their eggs they brood their eggs they hatch their chicks they brood their chicks they feed their chicks they molt and then theyre out to sea so a of that has to happen within that sixmonth perio thats a pretty busy bi so the penguins need to grow the chicks in order to be ready to go out there for six months out at sea really need to be very well suited for that so they nee need to be bi they need to be hefty they need to have their adult feathers so mm between the time that they actually hatch ou and the time that theyre ready to go out to sea is just a couple of months how long does it take for them to hatch well the incubation peri or um to have experience is anywhere depends on the species its its one month to two months oh okay okay s therefore you know basically between building a nest and mating and all of that other stuff you know they i would say that they have three months to to grow and get ready okay so theyre b now the funny thing is is tha according to mark ryan well h or just int i guess go watch them um mhm if you watch the trainers they walk into the exhibit and they start throwing penguins into the water and pushing them in and theyre all over the place um they try to get out sometimes they make it sometimes they fall back in gentus usually dive in head first these guys are falling in jumping in diving in so their behaviors if you will are are really interesting okay mhm its just its just a lot of fun to watch them um theyre doing something different with these chicks than weve done with the other penguins is that theyre trying to feed them crill um yesterday i think is th is th is when they tried it for the first ti and that cri is about as big as mhm you know from my joint up to the top of my finger here so its very difficult for a person to hold a crill and drop it into a penguins mouth so very good f s food source for them thats what they would feed on in the wild in addition to other things so what theyre trying to do is theyre throwing the crill into the water and seeing if the chicksll go for it so they tried it yesterday and they had some mixed success you know some animals were interested others were so y a apparently they theyll keep doing this so did were they werent doing that when you were in there no no no no okay when they were chicks cause what is it how does a mother fee a penguin chick doesnt she bring food to it she regurgitates it she regurgi it oh i sh shouldnt say she cause mother and father share bo oh share the duties okay but yeah they go out they fee and they regurgitate up the foo and thats how they feed the chicks mm actually other birds do that as well a lot mhm dont they a lot of bird do yeah yeah a lot of birds do thats right they never really did any well we h didnt regurgitate for the but they started them off with um stri of fi and they actually dipped it in a vitamin a u pureed crill batter mm dipped it in and then gave it to the penguin chicks so theyve been on solid foo hm for quite some ti a now its just interesting to see if theyll just go for the crill itself are they i mean are they being hesitant about it i didnt see it yesterday was the first time because they did it at el thirty and f oclock where the thats really interesting because i mean going from being handfe right right so i dont know so i would say if youve got the ti or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty hopefully theyll do it again today and itll be interesting to see so ill find out from mark um you know what the response with that is so four thirtys chick feeding yes are there any particular trainers working with the penguins uh hm are all the trainers allowed to work with the pen yeah well basically he um all of the trainers work with all of the animals so they rotate them arou basically excuse me so that the animals dont get attached to one person because if that person decides to lea then that could be detrimental to the animals but we do have a lead a lead person for each animal mark ryan is lead pengu mhm meg is lead o lisa takaki was lead la x mhm greg is lead seal so mark is basically calling the shots for how the programs gonna be structured so hes hes the penguin trivia guy so its a neat story mhm its its a very neat background story a i think you know for s for some of us underwater viewing gallery has not been your favorite place so this could uh uh this could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery could be a gift and actually just give a new focus on the penguins we havent done as much interpretation with the penguins as we do with the other animals so you actually have some kinda neat things to interpret here as far as whats going on some other things that you might see the penguins segregate themselves the species dont intermix okay if youve noticed that be mm the rockhoppers pretty much station themselves in the center the magellanics used to be off to the right and then well number ten could do whatever she wan the gentu but whats number ten i k im sorry i i k s i k i keep going number te whats number ten here kay the the penguins are numbered oh okay each penguin is number and o on the arm wing okay the the joint here well what do you call this the wing humerus hm at the humerus hu we would have a ta mhm and theyre colorcoded so if you were like to see well how does it work give me a number well they wear colors when i was there okay theyre colors but just seven did they move em to number they were going to wh it i is that green lets say for example green stands for one black stands for two thats number twel is that how it works yeah okay s they number them so tha when theyre feeding them and theyre taking down the records of okay number twelve ate five columbia river smelts and two capelands mhm they can keep a record of what the animal eats okay so they dont have names but she because sh because shes the lo feisty pengui number ten has become kind of famous in the penguin world downstairs so it it its a female th the only female gentu penguin that we ha prior to the chicks coming in o okay so um now youll see that theyre segregated actually the gentus have kind of broken up into clumps and theres from what i saw yesterday three different clu u lets see lets g lets interpret some of the behaviors we might see okay what is what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this i shouldnt say arms its wing wi its wing wings right u perspiring actually cooling o cooling off isnt it yeah yeah mhm so right he is where you dont where the penguins dont have a a dense covering of feathers so if they wanna cool off they tend to do this okay if i was to s a pengui doing this lifting one leg u its resting isnt it what else could it be sleeping no balance i guess its balancing its doing thinking tricks u actually it would be conserving heat o oh hm so the wi and the f le feet mhm theres no dense feather coverage on the on the legs so they might be conserving heat okay u i i saw a penguin sneezing what might be happening there allergic to food sick ive never heard a pen sneezing but cold okay it actually kind of s i know could you hear it how can you tell from it like shaking his head youll or sneezing youll see him youll s him just like what a person sneezing oh okay you can tell mhm when they jerk their h like that how was how does a penguin get its fresh water how does a penguin drink o i havent studied penguins in a while do do you know no hmmm from i thought a way w drank from pools just theyll drink salt wat salt water all uh also you know like the dolphins they actually metabolize the water thats stored in in the fat of the fish that they eat and thats how they get their water source mhm but basically youve gotta separate the fresh water from the salt water actually just have to separate out that salt so they have a special s they have to do tha so thats how theyre do oh thats what theyre doing when they sneeze is theyre getting rid of the sa salt oh that they have accumulated they have a salt gland in the beak and that is what separates the sa ou did you know that before and to get rid of that s they hmmm me neither they sneeze yeah actually oh i never even thought of that i remember doing the peng thing a year ago but i dont remember that adap no oh well u were gonna have to go up and do q and a in three minutes just looking at the clock whos do im facing the clock whos the diver i dont oh probably bernie u do they have different divers every mhm t yeah every day every day oh so that would be excreting salt um when i see a penguin picking its butt what is it d preening kinda like picking at its feathers preening preening okay preening its pree what is it doing whats at the base of the tail uh this is f you guy yeah right its at the it is fu whats at the base of the tail i wouldntve even thought of these thi well the anus is at the end of the tail its like oh didnt know they had meaning pardon me right the anus is at the end of the tail that i that is very true right but but lets say nea the anus what might be there why dont you answer this ques i got preen ah its okay its its the pr gland yeah oh o okay so its a gla that sto oi so what a penguin will do is itll go back itll squee the gland itll get some oil on its beak and then its rubbing that waterproofing so it can keep itself water righ mm waterproofing mhm oh all over its feathers hm mhm preening also consists of working an air layer at the base of the feathers because ai is a better insulator than wa if there was w touching the skin hm water is like a vacuum cleaner it is just gonna s the heat away mhm so by having the air there its a better insulator so when i see a penguin dive into the wa and i see all of these little air bubbles coming out what am i seeing the air is r is escaping from the feathers escaping right is compressed out from the so the penguin comes up on land and lets start again mhm and will start preening working that air layer in getting some oil spreading it ou how often do the mm how d often does the bird molt once a year once a yea okay s speciesll molt twice uhuh twice but basically if you think about it you know a year of picking at the feathers the feathers are gonna wear out mhm s the last thing that a penguin does before it goes out to sea i shed its yeah okay it does a clean sweep mhm and molts all of its feathers off and then gets the new feathers o okay so other than that um really the only t that they do with the penguins you know we train all kinds of behaviors with the other animals the the the the training that they do with the penguins is basically that they have feeding stations for them hm uh rockhoppers is here uh gentus is he magellanics is he and you are not gonna get a fi unless you come to your feeding station do they pretty much know that by now have they pretty much ada to that they were still in the room o when when i was here and they were they were pretty random about it because mark would take you know a bucket over here right and that was with the chicks and then whoev yeah o with the yeah i mean the ones that were in the the adult p the yeah the adult ones were fine about it mhm you know someone set up over here and someone over here and they pretty much went where they were supposed to so they knew to go to station o yeah versus sta t right yeah o s i guess not im not im not su but its just kind of interesting because other facilities as far as im aware its like with the sea otters as well you know uh the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal with the sea otters theyre pretty they can be aggressive they have big teeth people have historically done more training with cetaceans than they have with other animals and we we really do some pretty unique training here with our penguins with our sea otters and with our sea mhm so its kinda neat stuff cool anything else about penguins that we should discuss for you guys the key to the penguin ca if you d well i dont the puf cart uh are yeah the puffin cart mhm is o is behind the tide pool on one of re the reserve tanks so if you choose to pick a specimen you dont have to bring the whole cart out if you wanna grab a specimen hm and bring it out to the exhibit thats fine but i suggest that you check it out today anyway um theres just theres some neat things to interpret so check it out youve got underwater viewing yeah at three check it out so if theres a time you know for lori to go do it well ill probably go between coasta ill probably me coast downstairs okay cause theres a presentation close to four thirty okay great oh wait never mind ill do it then when theres a presentation at three perfect mhm so that is penguin stuff um i hate to say it but can you guys go do q and a or who or lori are you doing q and a no i dont think anyone signed up for q and a nobody sign up for q and a nobodys gonna do q and a i shouldve cancelled it then guys why wont somebody do q and a well both of us do it to you wanna do it yeah cause i cant remember the questions do it together you have to remind me the ques i gotta be down at the tide pool at two thirty alright thats okay okay o well do q and a and if its thanks guy uh what time is q and a two tw now a right now t me when i can get check out on seals two fifteen okay ill find y today wheres the um i will find you i dont wanna do it in two weeks ill forget wheres the no i wont i promise good afternoon ladies and gentlemen wed like to welcome you to the kentucky horse park and to the hall of champions presentation we have four geldings and one stallion that well present for you this afternoon and as we bring them out well give you the history on each one and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want and to ask questions our first horse here today at the hall of champions is our only thoroughbred stallion this is bold forbes bold forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion and he was foaled in nineteen seventythree he is by the stallion irish castle and out of the unraced mare comely nell he was bred by lee eaton and red bull stables this grandson of bold ruler was entered into a sale in july of nineteen seventyfour mister estaban tizol a banker and real estate developer from puerto rico liked bold forbes pedigree and he liked this horse so much that he decided he was going to buy him no matter what the cost the cost ended up being fifteenthousand twohundred dollars and bold forbes was then shipped to el commandante racetrack in san juan puerto rico in bold forbes very first start in puerto rico as a twoyearold he went off at odds of thirtyfive to one and he won that race by seventeen lengths he was entered into four more races he won them all and in doing so he was named champion twoyearold in puerto rico well el commandante is the only racetrack in puerto rico so it didnt take bold forbes too long to run out of competition so in the summer of nineteen seventyfive he was shipped to new york to his new trainer laz barrera in new york he won the freemont stakes and the saratoga special before he injured his shins and was given the rest of the year off well all of bold forbess races up to this point had been sprints or six furlong races the kentucky derby is a much longer race at a mile and a quarter so as a threeyearold forbes wasnt given much of a chance at all in the kentucky derby but his trainer had more confidence in him than that and with angel cordero junior in the saddle bold forbes won the kentucky derby at odds of seventeen to one one length in front of the leader honest pleasure the preakness however was a disappointment for bold forbes he cut his left hind heel during the race but he still managed to run third but when the belmont rolled around he had that all healed up and he won the belmont stakes by a neck in october forbes was entered into the vosburgh handicap and again he severely bruised his right hind foot again he ran a very game third but after this race he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury so he was retired to stud from the track bold forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share and he stood his entire career at arthur hancock stone farm as a stallion bold forbes produced a champion filly tiffany lass a winner of over half a million dollars bold apparel a champion filly in italy air forbes one and over twohundred other winners bold forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars in just two years on the racetrack he was in eighteen races and had thirteen wins and was never worse than third he was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninetyone he is twentyone years old and stands fifteen point three hands tall ladies and gentlemen the nineteen seventysix kentucky derby winner bold forbes does anyone have any questions while were waiting for the next horse to come out questions okay while were waiting ill just call everyones attention to this horse i dont know if everyone can see him over here in this paddock on the right this is sergeant pepper feature and hes usually in our show but because bold forbes is up here today he we kicked him out we have six horses that belong to the hall of champions and only five stalls so we could only have five at a time in the show um sergeant pepper was the nineteen eightytwo world champion racing quarter horse and at the time of his retirement he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history and he had earnings of over ninehundred thousand dollars so on your way out today you might wanna just take a look over there and say hi to sergeant pepper and theres bold forbes looking out the window if anybody can see him hes right there watching the show our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the hall of champions that is not a racehorse this is imperator and he is a fivegaited american saddlebred showhorse perry as he is commonly called is by the sire supreme sultan who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the horse park he is out of the dam empress wing and she is by the great sire wing commander only wing commander holds more world grand championships than imperator perry was born in wilmette illinois and he was purchased there as a twoyearold by his owner doctor geraldine meanor and then sent to his trainer don harris of simpsonville kentucky now perry and mister harris had a very special bond that they shared they both had the same birthday and as the years went past and imperators popularity increased mister harris didnt get too upset when perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did being fivegaited means that perry performs the three natural gaits the walk trot and canter plus two manmade gaits the slow gait and the rack the only difference in these gaits are the speed at which theyre performed perrys greatest accomplishment was winning the fivegaited world grand championship four times and he has also been reserve world champion five times he was shown eightyfive times at fortyfour shows around the country he has sixtyeight blue ribbons thirteen seconds and very rarely was he ever worse than third now the first time perry was shown he was very wild and inexperienced and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring and he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions but the second time he was shown he had improved so much the judges said he would have won if hed been lying on his back with all four feet stuck up in the air perrys most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail at the highlight of his career perrys tail was fourteen feet long and could be wrapped completely around his body if you wanted to take a picture of all of perry you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail when perry was retired mister harris cut his tail to make it easier to care for and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from perrys tail well perry had been retired here for about two years but had never had a formal retirement so in august of nineteen ninetyone perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in louisville kentucky that night imperator and his trainer mister don harris stepped into the ring one last time together and were both named the american saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteeneighties perry is now twenty years old and stands fifteen point three hands tall ladies and gentlemen the fourtime world grand champion imperator does anyone have any questions while were yes whats the average age that a horse lives to a good average is about twentyeight if theyre well taken care of um a lotta horses will live into their thirties a a good way to compare horse ages to humans is to multiply by three and except i think the oldest liv oh oldest horse on record i think in the guinness book of world records was sixtytwo so dont multiply that that one by three that would be what a hundred and eightysix or something are there any other questions no if anyones interested in seeing what perry looked like when he had his fourteenfoot tail um when you come into the visitor center i dont know if if anybody noticed this theres a tv monitor right after you where you b your tickets when you come in and you look up and theres a an ongoing hall of champions presentation on this tv monitor up there and uh theres a little clip of imperator on there and i think hes slowgaiting which was his most beautiful gait um and you can see his fourteenfoot tail up there and that was it was really beautiful do you have a question back there he wants to know how you say hi to a horse um just say hi you can just say hi and they and you can say their name cause they know their names so if you wanted to say hi to imperator just and he goes by perry so if you just come up to him and say hi perry hell know youre talking to him our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the hall of champions this is forego forego is by the argentine stallion forli and he is out of the champion race mare lady golconda he was bred and raised at claiborne farm in paris kentucky due to foregos large size he was not raced as a twoyearold because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature he started his racing career as a threeyearold and he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventythree kentucky derby well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named secretariat won the kentucky derby on his way to sweeping the triple crown well forego wasnt as successful as secretariat that day but he did run a fine race he was involved in a bumping incident as the horses left the starting gate he recovered from that but he and another horse our native bumped through the entire stretch and both horses ended in a photo finish for third after the stewards inquiry forego had to settle for fourth because the steward said the bumping was all his fault the older forego got the better he got and he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race he has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century being a handicap horse means that forego ha forego had to carry a lot of extra weight over whatever distance he was asked to run in order to give the other horses more of a chance he was in thirtyfour handicap events and thirty times he was the highweighted horse the most weight forego ever had to carry to victory was a hundred and thirtyseven pounds and that was in the nineteen seventysix marlboro cup well before the race it had rained and the track was sloppy and forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet so as the field turned for home it looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten some ten lengths behind the leader honest pleasure honest pleasure had been the kentucky derby favorite that year he was three years younger than forego and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight but determined to win forego made up that last quarter mile in twentytwo seconds flat and he beat honest pleasure at the wire the jockey that rode forego the great willy shoemaker said there wasnt a horse alive that couldve beaten forego on that day forego was named horse of the year three consecutive years in nineteen seventyfour seventyfive and seventysix and he has also been champion sprinter as well as champion handicap horse an eclipse award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive and forego holds eight eclipse awards which is more than any other horse forego retired in nineteen seventyeight with earnings of over one point nine million dollars which made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time behind kelso he was inducted into racings hall of fame in nineteen seventynine forego is one of our senior citizens here at the hall of champions he is twentyfour years old and stands a very impressive seventeen point one hands tall ladies and gentlemen the great handicap horse forego does anyone have any questions questions okay oh okay i dont have my glasses on i couldnt see you what is the average weight for a horse um it varies um like probably lets see forego probably weigh around t oh about twelve hundred maybe twelve fifty some of the draft horses weigh over a to in the draft horse barn some of the the belgians are the biggest horses the the shires are the tallest but the belgians are the heaviest and have you been to the draft barn yet uh did you see roy and captain the two big belgians they weigh they both weigh over two th i th i know roy does im not sure about captain but roy weighs over two thousand pounds yes isnt secretariat didnt he die and wasnt he buried on this property somewhere uh uh hes buried at claiborne farm claiborne mhm how did he die pardon how did he die he was put down he had laminitis which is a disease of the h of the hoof and and they put him down our next horse to come out today is our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here and youll see that hes a lot smaller than forego this is john henry john henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings he is by the stallion old bob bowers who was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either and he is out of the brood mare once double who outside of john henry had very little success as a brood mare john was born on march ninth nineteen seventyfive at golden chance farm in paris kentucky the farm kept john until nineteen seventysix when he was consigned to the keenenland january mixed sale now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse its usually when people try to sell the horses they dont think are worth feeding through the winter so because of his small size his lack of pedigree but most of all his very nasty disposition john brought only eleven hundred dollars and from the time of this first sale until may nineteen seventyeight john was sold over half a dozen times because nobody wanted him and nobody could get along with him but in may of nineteen seventyeight a new york businessman sam rubin decided it would be fun to own a racehorse well mister rubin didnt know anything about horses and the only thing he knew about racing is where the valet parking was so he bought john henry over the telephone sight unseen for twentyfive thousand dollars john then went to new york to his first trainer bobby donato in his very first new york start he won a twentyfive thousand dollar claiming race over the dirt by one and a half lengths his next race was on turf which john preferred to run on and again he won but this time by fourteen lengths well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than mister rubin did advised him to send john west where the turf racing was more lucrative more competitive and run all year long so in late nineteen seventynine john headed west to his new trainer ronald mcanally in nineteen eighty john won over ninehundred thousand dollars in nineteen eightyone john won the very first arlington million over one point seven million dollars and was voted horse of the year in nineteen eightytwo and nineteen eightythree john had some injuries and only won four races but they mounted up to one point two million dollars and when mister mcanally wanted to bring john henry back as a nineyearold folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age well john did lose his first race that year but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack he won six graded stakes including a repeat victory in the arlington million over two point three million dollars and again was voted horse of the year when john was retired in nineteen eightyfour he was the worlds richest thoroughbred in history with earnings over six point five million dollars since then alisheba has beat his record but john is still the richest gelding john holds seven eclipse awards which is second only to foregos eight and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety john was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade for the nineteen eighties john has been retired here for eight years now he is nineteen years old and stands a very small fifteen point one hands tall ladies and gentlemen the great great john henry does anyone have any questions yes the horses that retire here how much exercise and what kind of xx xxx okay these horses are are not ridden anymore um theyre just l like you said theyre retired they each have their own paddock except for sergeant pepper and imperator they we turn them out together because theyre friends and mostly they just hang out in their paddock and they graze and they exercise themselves they run around a lot and keep themselves in shape and thats about all they do they get they get lots of treats and lots of lo and s we think theyre happy but they still run around um just like young horses sometimes john will get out there and run around hell rear up on his hind legs like silver you know and do and uh its real cute uh foregoll run around willie and his little goat will get out there and and run and imperator usually likes to trot he doesnt gallop a lot but he trots around like he did when he was showing and its theyre real cute there any other questions yes what uh the goat in with the horse are they just good friends uhuh thats his little buddy theyre just friends he willie doesnt really like other horses very well and and he likes people but hes not as affectionate as maybe perry or sergeant pepper so we dont want him to get lonely and thats his thats his little friend originally they had got the goat for john henry when he first came to live here eight years ago and they put the goat in the stall with him he kicked it back out and um so willie adopted it and that original goat died about a year ago and willie was real sad and depressed so they got him a new one our last horse to come out today is our standardbred representative rambling willie a standardbred races at a trot or a pace and they pull a sulky with a driver willie is a pacer willie was born in monroeville indiana and he began his racing career as a toyearold for his owner raymond gibson he had four starts with two seconds and two thirds so he did show some promise but mister gibson decided to sell willie as a threeyearold willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver mister robert farrington for fifteen thousand dollars but not long after he bought him mister farrington decided hed spent too much money on this horse so he called a friend of his from cincinnati ohio mister paul sebert and he tried to talk mister sebert into buying a half interest in willie well mister sebert had owned horses before and his luck had been pretty bad the first horse he owned died before it made it to the racetrack and the second horse he owned made it to the races and she ran and ran but just couldnt win anything so he sold her and after he sold her she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner well mister sebert did buy a half interest in willie though and things didnt start off so well there either willie was being raced at county fairs in ohio and indiana and was being beaten on a regular basis well around this time mister farringtons wife vivian was having a birthday and he was trying to decide what to get her so mister farrington decided that a good present for vivian would be the other half of willie well vivian was a very religious person and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church so vivian decided that if willie ever had any success at the racetrack she would donate ten percent of her half of willies earnings to her fathers church and thats when willies racing career took off because of his success and his ties to the church there was a book written about willie titled rambling willie the horse that god loved in order to promote his book willie would hold autograph sessions one day when willie was in new york he had an autograph session at macys department store and he was such a hit there that macys gave him his very own charge card well willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race he raced from the age of two to thirteen he had an incredible threehundred and five starts he won a hundred and twentyeight times sixtynine times he finished second and seventynine times he paced the mile in two minutes or less which is a record willie still holds today when he retired he was the richest standardbred in history with earnings over two million dollars willie is our other senior citizen here at the hall of champions he is twentyfour years old and stands fifteen point two hands tall ladies and gentlemen the horse that god loved rambling willie now ill just let everybody know that willies book is for sale here at the horse park gift shop and wed like to thank everyone for coming to the horse park and to the hall of champions presentation we hope youve had a good day and if you have any questions feel free to ask us on your way out thank you very much well lets kind of figure out a cla u uh diet uh quota uh uh for you and let me get a piece of paper so that we can write that down the way we do this yeah is first of all we make a a guesstimate of how many calories typically that you would need d we we didnt do this last time did we hmm ok alright yeah i think we were gonna wait until we cause you were gonna change some things maybe after you saw doris so first of all we make a good guesstimate of how many calories you need and thats always a tough one um mhm m women unless you work out a l you probably arent burning much more than like eighteen hundred to maybe two thousand calories mhm so what we can do um i would say im gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred just because uh youre at a good weight youre about five fi u i think that would be a prudent place to to start out from i know i wont uh cause you to gain weight and you probably wont lose any either but uh okay so were gonna take eighteen hundred ca uh h how um how many calories do you think im eating now or can you even tell that from looking i could do a calorie count um on that but id actually need more amounts although you wouldnt be able to tell because theres no uh i dont write down like the fa and things like that well if if you gave me real specific amounts like i had you know one quarter cup of soy milk half a cup of cereal yeah th i could oh okay i could cou your cal i see and and figure that out and run it through the computer and get a printout mm hm o your nutrient ratio and everything wow for the day in fact if you wanna do that id be glad to run it for you but youd have to take one day mhm and re and write everything down yeah be like precise okay u okay so eighteen hundred calories ti point four thats gonna be f calories or excuse me um forty percent of your calories coming from carbo hydrate and thats doriss standard protoc really mm okay times point four gives us seven hundred and twenty carbo calorie yeah then we divide that by four calories per gram youve i know youve seen this before which gives us a quota of a hundred and eighty gra of carbohydrate per day actually i shouldve done that mm okay then we have to di it wow thats lo yeah thats not that much it is then we have to distribute that into a an ideal ratio now you always do have breakfast really unless youre running a bit on the higher side really high yeah and you always have some kinda lunch pretty much and you al have some kind of dinner well yeah basical now the midmorning snack the snacks are hit and miss thats where we maybe would h have to to look at things a little bit more closely but u lunch and dinner are your main meals and we would give you about a thirty percent quota at both lunch and dinner which is about fifty fou grams at each of those places hm would be sort of your ballpark quota and uh its not outlandish like here you were sixtyfour well a little bit higher u mm here well you were about uh forty fiftyni s so sixtyfour fifty that was seventyfour so its a little bit higher is what youre used to doing m a u yes yeah uh i remember like a lo long time ago lets see uh it was i guess f maybe forty fortyfive seventy or some o thats how they had it di up okay i think although thats m mo right lets see t_sounds pretty high thats yeah yeah thats what a total of a hun and it mightve been based either on a higher calorie level o a higher percent of your calories coming from carbos mhm mhm like if this were fifty percent mhm which is probably more realistic for how you eat mhm being a vegetarian you eat more uh and we can change it up but well use this as a ba and then we wanna compare it mhm to what you typically do and the thing is if you started doing this right now youd have low blood sugars ri cause youve already adjusted your insulin yeah to another level m but i think what you could learn from this is tha u at least if you sort of cho a s place for a while mhm until you got things a little more stabilized it might be easier to do your insulin mhm mhm and then um once you y are a little more comfortable with that the you can start doing this f with r adding the unit for another ten grams say if you usually have sixtyfour and you find you know ex units of insulin works for tha mhm well uh then you can jockey it from there now at breakfast we often keep that down around twe be twe wow uh percent uh oh point one two ti i thought you meant gra i was gonna say h where do you find foo thats that low well some people actually end up having to do that thats only about twenty grams zero or something because of that dawn phenomenon mm mm so thats not much at all the yeah like even an english muffin is too much unhunh unhunh even oat its its uh really difficult you can either have either or sort of a thing lets see sixty seventytwo okay so that gives us a twentyeight to distribute throughout the rest of the day a um making a decision of how to do that really involves your insulins now in the morning youve got a good amount of regular insulin that you take mhm so i would wanna put a little bit higher percentage for your snack there like m i would say maybe even ten percent here u see i ha that sna uh having to eat snacks uh oh i just dont have ti you know the on t with that is uh uh at breakfast you just wont have your insulins there for you to eat the big carbo breakfast typically mm unless you run hi after breakfast and then it comes down when the insulins finally do get working mhm but then youre run high mhm and thats you know thats the only way to protect yourself right is yeah you eat a bunch of carbo you take a bunch of insulin you run high for an hour and a half right and then all of a sudden it comes s down mhm when all the insulins get on board mhm so um righ any uh point one okay thats just gonna be eighteen i wonder how roughly there uh how does doris do that though because she like i dont think she eats lu or anything i mean she just like has this really minimal dose of nph i think youd have to ask her thats what uh i do know thats what i suspe i dont know the trade secrets there um bu uh h uh you know i think pro u keeping the carbo a little on the lower side enable of course then youd need less insulin which makes life easi m mhm it does make it easier if you do eat less carbo cause you dont have to take these big amounts and then wonder what theyre gonna do and when m u this actually sometimes makes it more complicated now mid afternoo you are taking a touch of regular at lu but you do really eat much of a snack usually after lunch cause you have a late lunch might have some cheetos there i see mhm oh that was just cause i was like u couldnt eat dinner cashews hm u i had to go to something like right at at six oclo or seven oclock or something so that really may be o whe its sort of debatable you know maybe at the most youd have five percent there u and im just sort of guessing as a place to sta uh whyd i do that i knew what it was and thats just hardly anything thats a f some a few nuts really and thats about it or uh u then later on you do sometimes eat after dinner cause youre kind of a nightowl a u lets see thisll go twentytwo plus uh so were looking at about roughly thirteen fifteen percent there so okay so approximately well s essentially like breakfast so those would just be places to start from but i think um whats even more im o i youve gotta tailor it to what your insulin is and use these as a jumping off place you know if you say well this is ridiculous i always have a seventy carbo dinner mhm well so what you know uh theres nothing wrong with that it just means you slightly adjust that insulin same thing if you do like snacks what are you gonna do to co m for the fact that theres theres a lotta insulin there maybe a um m uh how are you gonna get around that um but thats the sole purpose of snacks is to really prevent lows from happening and to counteract um the insulin time actions u so hm m oh maybe we should compare uh go ahead oh i just had one question s for example unhunh say i didnt eat lunch then what would happen like then i could not take the insulin there and then well but the i dont know you probably would need to eat a little something i wonder i would get high then maybe hunh becau of your nph peaking mhm mhm although you dont ta a lo of nph so in the morning yeah it may be debatable if you really need to have something later in the af uh or b to get you into dinner okay um hmm you know you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack if you dont mhm um o yeah take look at look at the nph that youre taking a y uh doris could help you with that did she give you a scale for a w no lunch lunch scale a w whi ago but um it changed after that see this was the original thing that i had she said but okay this was hm this was a while ago see three twentyfour ninetyfour so um like for example she had these two things so if i wa gonna eat like say i i decided ok in the morning i was gonna eat lunch then i would take fou units of nph and then supplement it with the regular but if i knew like say in the morning that i wasnt gonna eat lunch then hm she said take uh but this doesnt make any sense to me take six nph cause i would be low with thi then definitely you know yeah in in the afternoon hunh okay yeah uh i think this was kinda guessing well too uh cause it was before hm uh i had real yeah definitely um uh you know ch with her on your insulins cause uh you know she is the only one that can really clarify them u uh you know just its tough to to do the jockeying of of the food and the insulin it really um uh mm it it just it makes it really um a a challenge there to well this is where i got the idea that she d uh probably doesnt eat lunch well uh i dont know how she would have ti anyway every time you see her its like you know five minutes here five minutes there but um then also just like um i dont know she sort of like knew what i mea when i was saying unhunh unhunh oh its such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch mhm you know and so um thats where i got that idea but mm mhm well its uh yeah lets see and so four of n six of n and then zero regular there yeah hm thats where just monitoring monitoring monitoring um m lets you know if if its gonna work for you or not if its too strong or not str enough mhm u yeah yeah r so its well anyway how can i how can i help you with all this i feel like uh were uh still in a pickle in that um its just every day is so different a you know youre youre ad your insulins ri uh per your uh protocols that you have there and the carbos are varying arou that um but uh you know i think its important we uh make some kind of a a goal to uh prevent these low from happening mhm a uh try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high and you know wh do you th u that uh you could do to h clarify this a little bit more and oh make it a little easier well i guess maybe if i try thi m maybe thats the only way cause it seems like to me that um i dont know i dont know its maybe its ea if i have like some kind of set thing cause then yeah something to shoot for uh yeah kinda uh cause otherwise ill just do whatever i feel like doing right you know right uh obviously x well uh you you could give this a try as far as the levels but what i would do is is u what youre currently doing as sort of a backup guide because obviously if youre having and and this has cha a lot uh over the past few days but um well one day you have thirtyeight at breakfast the next day you have none um uh yeah but thats like if it hi for and it also like sometimes i just write em in different columns cause o cause uh depending on what time it was but if youre having only you know around and what you could do is sort of rou these a little bit like shoot for say twentyfive or mhm just say every morning youre gonna have a thirty mhm like a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast per mhm thats um uh it it would work and then you just start learning from that mhm you kn you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement on what you w doing as far as uh dropping it down a little bit mhm mhm and yet it would be s it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast or br ri right or english muf so you could just l into that and uh see see how that goes um uh mid morning well thats kind of a debatable one cause you dont really l to have the sn mhm bu try it and see maybe carry something with you and it could be something simple you might make this just sort of a a plastic baggie full of crackers that you take wi you wherev you go mhm right and just make it a standard h m or it could be a piece of fruit that is gonna be approximately in that ballpark and lunchtime i i would say maybe rounding it i might round it to sixty so so what if we increase your quota up to about fortyfive per mhm its not a big deal that thats not the most important thing the main thing is that youre trying to hit those quota cons mhm u he i dont think youll have any problem eating something later on after dinner if anything its its gonna be trying to maybe keep this dow mhm aroun fifteen to thirty or something in that ballpark mhm but i agree that if you can make it a l mo rock steady you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more if you have a schedule that youre trying mhm to to go for but these are a little bit more scientifically derived yeah mhm mhm based on uh what insulins are doing a a and when right so yeah hm ques uh no im just i was just looking at this number and thinking oh if i only eat that amount of carbohydrate at dinner ill be just like dro uh you know a night lo with your and and that is so annoy its like you have to keep eating and keep eating cause ive had that happen well maybe realistically what you wanna do is keep this one uh because lunch well what are you gonna have really youre gonna have yeah a couple tortillas or maybe a sandwich or some along that line yeah maybe realistically this is only abou forty or fiftyi yeah okay so thats fine uh i would just adjust this to fifty or fortyfive or whatever you see fit mhm but dinner youre right you have control in that you have a regular sliding scale that you can use and maybe b realistically you should make this seventy mhm mhm and just but but call it seventy and then r try to stand by that and l at the insulin look at your numbers before and after and what does happen over the course of the evening um do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours or mhm uh uh or what mhm but but look at it and see but stand by it make it like seventy and then just stick to it uh uh mhm u o s okay so a thats something you could play with for uh a little while and see if if it um helps in getting rid of some of the outliers that were trying to fix up so u other questions uh whatd you do sabrina nothing i left the phone in my bedroom last night and so im grounded from the phone it was an accident you guys are always in trouble whats up with that mo a b get your feet off of there get

know and he says i get up i wasnt planning on coming in until eight and here i am early and so she comes in she says i apologize for for being late and everything shes i forgot we might have to scrape windows out here cause shes from arkansas and so she went into the community afterwards shes it hasnt been a good morning she says i bought four five pairs of new pants before i left and had em

i told you to yester yeah i took some this morning then too okay just to make sure i think you know and you might be just a bug that kind of a flu achy type thing yea yeah cause jenny had that flu today she went ho today and a lot of people have had it b you know the like s fall paula went in and found out to the doctor she was tired of just having this kind of just not f real well and she thought she had an ear infection mhm she went in and she she had a sinus infection mhm gave her some antibiotics she goes at least ill get over it then yeah yeah you know so i think it just might have been something around but god that was the weirdest thing thats what i did all day today i had three or four different kids come up and complain of nasal sinus problems so every time one of the doc their docs came on i wrote another order and i know its just called bruce and added their name its just one of these long going flu things bruce wanted to go hunting today and every time i call him i says youre not get out here early and then finally he told me he says uh he wasnt going today with mike anyhow mike left early m and wasnt going hunting today so in fact then i didnt leave until f four oclock and then him at the copier machine i said so much for getting out on ti on f oh yeah well i thought mm i said paula i can stay if you want me to cause i wasnt doing anything and we didnt do anything all day long pretty much it was boring we had custom can i just have a little bit of that soup just to try it i tried its really spicy annette oh yeah thats alright da uh doesnt cut up his onions as s as smooth as i do and i think when i made it i used my salsa not his salsa yeah and when the chili powder says two to four teaspoons he used the four i prob used two he used the four so its real it open up your sinuses well i like i like the onions i just wanna try it yeah it just smells so good well tr a couple spoonfuls and i think ill only cook it for about another half hour and then ill turn it off yeah um because well we had customer appreciation day so we had hot dogs and then we had the retirees come and theyre really nice ladies and we got corco corsages for em and stuff you know they really like that and um theyre like this is probably the last year you guys get to do this with the merger and were like yeah probably but um they were really nice and but we had hot dog i just had a hot dog for lunch i was gonna go buy something and i thought god why waste money on a hot dog when i or uh on food when i could just eat a hot dog so i had two of em and i mean the first one kinda tasted pretty good and i ate the other one then half of the other one it was like whoah yeah i dont l hot dogs that well but and then we had cake we had that carrot cake from costco that carrot cake mhm and the chocolate with the cream f filling stuff mhm its not real sweet at all its more like a butter cream kinda thing and then unhunh mints and nuts and so i ate nut oh those cashews i just kept eating em i ate more today than i probably have all week long though and then but it was kinda nice well like i said i didnt do anything all day oh i was busy all day mm cause we opened

in an envelope there and uh i was asking anne what we were going to get her for her new office she decorates her home and her office l by chinese and i thought this was really strange cause shes hispanic you know and and all y when we went to her house all the oriental things and i says what sh lettie needs is plant uh cause she loves plants but they die on her and in her office if i wouldnt water em and take care of em she wouldnt have had any pla god so i says what about a ni either silk plant or one of the silk trees that would sit behind her desk then you know mhm i says thats very soothing when shes doing therapy and stuff and anne says thats a good idea and i says you know costco has some real reas ones or you can uh silk warehouse for some of em and shes i think thats a good idea and then she can her real other decor she can do as she wants and pre yeah wheres her office wheres did she mo or is she still here well no shes th shes just going in with some of the doctors

the one doctor who lost his wife this summer when they were on vacation yeah shes gonna take over her practice oh cause their their therapy styles are quite similar oh a uh you know all these patients w since the death was so sudden all these pa were just kinda left on a yeah and so shes been illing in quite a bit hm yeah a that just kinda made her final decision cause she said when she graduated from grad school thats what she wanted to do in five years have her own practice and she said but thats scary to do oh yeah and she says so the opportunity the patients are there so it was a perfect op it helps yeah even though the circumstances are not the best xx xx pri practice hm mhm when uh we sent amy flowers cause shes staying with her mom now cause she has to be watched oh yeah and so we go we dont know if we should send em to tony or to amy because amy and tony they fight like cats and dogs anyway and then when youre not feeling well and you know and amy just flo goes off the handle cause tonys no you know no bugging and nosy and and im like i dont know who wed wanna send flowers to cause theyre both gonna drive each other crazy well youre not the most pleasant person when youre sick i n no one is thats the thing yeah but they dont get along i mean that well well you just dont listen to me im the nurse and i tell you i alw listen to you annette you do no do too do not just take your medi do this thats the way jenny went home today sick and i said you go buy some orange juice i said take some liquids i said i dont want you going out at all this weekend what did she say thank you mother she goes im not oh i said i dont wanna see you out one of the little kids came up to me and he said i got something to tell you alice and i said what he said i bit both sides of my tongue and so he sticks his tongue out and shows me i said well dont do that anymore and he says and it hurts like heck and i said well dont do that anymore what a dipshit and this one little kid whos been really having a problem the other day he was tracking so well and i says well i says in the morning then if you track really well let me know and ill s well ill get the sa tr ill save that tracking sheet and give it to you you can have it then and you can show your parents when they come in he was so excited the next morning i barely walked on the unit and he hes screaming alice alice he says guess what i tracked good all day long then i forgot to turn it in so he still stayed on level three uh poor kid mm so i says and but he was okay with that but he says i know i did really good and i says i know you did too and you can do good today so he did really good to today also but he was the little kid the other day before his mother came to visit physically worked himself up into such a state that he threw up three times before she came was he excited to see her or didnt wanna see her well this is the new stepmother and hes really excited but hes uh hes just such a hyper kid when he gets involved in that couldnt bel it mm wa do you have a bunch of homework and stuff to do tomorrow well thatll be good if diane and i are out of here yeah i mean i dont have a lo cause actually this week in my methods course its pretty mellow but i finally got a hold of bishop kelly they fi called me back about what someone there my observation i have to do there i have to do twenty hour oh you are gonna do it not my student teaching my observation totally different well who sets that up you or well you they you just set it up through the education department they have to call and app you to gi oh i mean they have to say you know s i have five students coming these are the names so you arent just having these weirdos coming and saying im su to observe your school yeah you know and so finally doctor deliando called me back today i called wednesday and yesterday and then he called me back he called me this morning but i wasnt in yet so so when do you start that i go in tuesday to meet him and to get it set up then hm so xx how do you say his name deliando i dont think thats how you oh thats what they told me oh okay i didnt think thats how you pronounced a good old basque name but xxxx well thats what ive b i mean thats yeah so then are you j uh do you observe different teachers uh o one teacher i can pick he goes ill introduce you to em and he goes and then you can pick and pick which ones you want then you should s in in miss browns and some of those i wonder if shes still those arent english oh you have to do eng hunh hm i dont know any of the english teachers now but i ill probably i mean you get bo doing it i mean and they want you to uh if you can help you know maybe grade paper or mhm hm do something but its also a lot of work for the teacher to find something that a s yeah that you can do just being there an hour a week or two hours a week yeah so th sometimes you ca but sometimes you get bored i mean i watching the same class for twenty hours thats boring just sitting there yeah so i mean if you can get involved it it helps you plus yeah it also helps pass the time but so i told mickey im like mickey im gonna be in late uh tuesday shes like annette i dont care you just make your own schedule anyway you just come and go as you please i dont care well i asked cathlene i said right after we got off the phone i said id be there at

just leave me a sticky so i know yeah and then i go ill leave a sticky on tonys so she thinks that you know we include her in things i told mickey mickeys like i do ca uh what does does chris teach teach there uh last i heard she did that was last year but wouldnt it be funny if she taught english and you got to sit in she teaches biolo well i know mo rats you just dont know whats going on at that school anymore well i didnt know thats sad about that kid in the paper who whos in the coma he was a the star f baseball player at bk and he got that scholarship to he was what a gatorade player of the year two years ago and then he w but i thought it w hi dad who was in the hospital no its hi hes in a co oh okay he got hit by that drunk driver and his younger brother plays at bk and has a football game and i g it wa the pa the article was about you know how theyre all gonna g all the familys gonna go to the game today because sports are very important in this family you know yeah and they all used to go watch the older brother play baseball and thats what he would want is their family to be at the game and oh um really the coach i think its tim lincoln or yeah yeah one of the lincolns said you know if you dont wanna play thats fine if you d dont wanna if you g have to come out of a play you just do whatever but it was like go well thats like theres a lot of pressure on this football team yeah cause because nick osettys son is yeah mhm i mean its his dad whos the field is dedicated to yeah and he wants to dedicate his senior year to the his dad in memory of his dad cause he was a star player yeah s and they play kuna and isnt th always that your homecoming no cause we usually lose to kuna so i think we had to p we always played like payette that we like beat every year oh for like seventeen years and then i think our senior year junior or senior year we lo to em and they beat you yeah yeah it was like oh go but the only reason i went to the game was just to figure out what was going on afterwards so it didnt really matter i know well i never knew i didnt i could never even tell you half the players on the yeah you play football mm i knew the ones that mattered yeah i went to a couple of the jv games you know what im saying louiss game team lost wednesday though so theyre two and mhm five and two now theyve only lost two games they lost to centennial the other day well i thought maybe thats what he was doing last night cause when we came by the stadiu uh the pavilion the football field at bsu the lights were on well the seniors play they have uh uh they have game in the varsity has games thursday and friday oh o cause they cant always get all the games in especially when it s gets dark this early now yeah they have to have a lot more games and then most of the schools dont have fields you can play at in boise dont have lights no but there sure were so there uh werent a lot of people there oh yeah probably but that was seven oclock i dont know what time the game started ah just kind of their games usually start at seven yeah on wednesdays mhm but varsity yeah i dont know varsity probably starts at seven maybe its an eight oclock seven seven thirty yeah there werent a whole lot of yeah might have been mhm they were probably may maybe playing an outoftown team too and i know dad said yeah i dont know why they have the lights on yet because it still was really light out yeah well they have to get em on so they can yeah get it going and i thought maybe that was i thought may it was the sophomores yeah xxxx well i thought louiss game was at four fortyfive i know they have one afternoon game but its next wednesday i found out and so i was gonna go and watch his game after work you know i get off work right at five mhm then go go to work at xx and then then he had a game at seven and i was like oh and then my legs hurt i couldnt have walked anywhere anyway that was a weird thing mhm yeah cause diane came in today and she goes whats wrong with your legs mom and dad were f out about it and i said it was it was freak well thats how come i called in the morning yeah you know cause i didnt wanna go in and wake you up and say how are your legs annette and its like how the hell do you think they are my legs are fine but im tired but i need some more sleep and then so then i remem uh luckily i remembered to call early enough otherwise i was gonna call you at work yeah xx but then i thought thatd be kinda stupid i call you at work and if you didnt go to work theyll say no shes home sick today and kinda like what kinda mother are you you live in the sa house we they know th i mean that we have different schedules and stuff hm but yeah theyre like i said theyre s theyre still kinda sore like achy kinda sore but theyre i mean theyre i can walk and every i think its more of a flu they arent so thats what i think it was though bug yeah cause i didnt have an appetite or anything else like that and i think thats part of it i mean well you could i have to be sick to not eat now ive made up for it though today everything looked good i was like oh cause jenny and i had to go over to the store and get the punch and um cups and stuff for the open house today and i mean everything looked good at the store and she was sick so nothing looked good to he and i was like that looks good doesnt that look good no no that was like yesterday after i got my car fixed g i went and took it in for you know the maintenance thing and it was a free one thats what you told me yeah a uh then dad wanted to go get that oil for the fans to oil put on the fans i said well you go do that and ill go to the grocery store and i was hungry then cause this was three oclock and i had breakfast at eight oclock yesterday man everything looked good so a hundred dollars later i walked out of the grocery store and then we went last night oh to get stuff for the sou for dad yeah oh gee for hunting no he doesnt

went out in the morning im like oh go so i get out of my car stop in the driveway take em off of each other i was like ill just kill them those naughty boys but um mm no he just he he hes become mo

everything ive had to deal with my fa i id listen to my sister when my nephew started college how she was saying she filled out all of his applications for where he was go and she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever she filled out everything and im like i did it by myse you read the form and you fill it out wo no one did it for me you know and i was very uh much whatever i needed i i got my money from my fa he paid for schoo but i did everything on my own i i didnt ha anyone see my parents werent very i dont know theyre not extremely educated and theyre not really on top of things and so when it came to things like that they w know how to help me really yeah they wouldnt i mean they had no clue they didnt give me any suggestions of where to go to school they said oh yeah go to school well pay for it we want you to go to school but they had no idea of you know whats a good school whats a bad school you know any type of di se uh uh yeah they didnt give me anything like that and see i f thats one of the biggest setbacks i i see this with with bla youths today is that becau your generations in the pa were not educated mm you have a harder time deciding on whats a good school whats a good curriculum for you to ta your your parents arent able to talk to you about it w just as you were saying even though youre not black but you were just saying that but black children have that even more so right because you har youre youre more likely not to be ha come from educated parents whereas i came from an educated family it was just the fact they made us do everything on our ow and mm but uh black people also th those that have more tried to teach you to be stro but i think they instilled s tried m tried to make me so strong that they forgo that i was a person and i mean like i i often feel like at times that and maybe its the gayness coming out in me but i dont like it like and when i was ho just went home to indiana i went to hug my sister and i still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging she doesnt like to hug no my familys not very much h oh i mean my whole life weve never been very you greet someone you dont s hug them youre just like hi how are you and even like male female you dont do it see uh my my mother was like that more so and then my f was d very emotional very hugging yeah very hugging they were just see my family is more its its different its like mm uh each member of the family is s different and different a amount of touch i always sai that if i had children i would always especially if i had a son i would hug him just so he knew that i loved him ri i think its important i think its good i dont think you can overly hug um with family and stuff like that yeah see and thats how i feel is that i want to hug him because i want him to know that i do love him mhm and that i i i want my children if i if i ever ha children to know tha there is nothing wro with showing physical affection between two men it doesnt make you gay right you know and tha is one of the things that scott was saying yesterday it really bothered scott a lot because his nephew uh kept calling him aunt sco because and his nephew was just being rude and obnoxious about every gift he he unwrapped and his brother said oh thats just the way kids are today and im like no thats the way you train your kids if you dont train your kids to be any better then they are and see and in scotts family like his brother his older brotherll say oh scotts my best friend but hell tease scott about oh why arent you married you know you must be a fa or this and hell lau it off and he doesnt realize well yeah scott i gay and it hurts scott he doe know that hes gay hmmm has no idea hes probably hes gonna drop him off which is why i have to close those blinds soon bu uh it its the way he is and his brother is just like that and so he and h and so his little boy is growing up the same way larrys twelve and he like this big kid cause hes overweight and i told scott i said well scott i wouldnt take it personal cause scott was telling me this morning i said first of all larrys twelve years old hes like six foot one and hes fat i mean hes just probably a good two hundred fifty pounds i said hes six one at twelve at twelve years old oh thats scary and hes like two hundred and fifty pounds and i said scott hes compensating for the fact i said i bet you the kids pick on him i said hes different i said so therefore he probably is a big bully at school and i said so hes probably just like this kid whos just like rea bitter because nobody and i said his dad is just an a a jerk scotts brother will call our hou and just is just rude to scott but yet hell turn around and ask scott to borrow five thousand dollars i mean like he just borrowed twentyfive thousand dollars from scott like two years ago and told scott oh ill give it back im gonna invest it and ill give it back in three months so he gives scott it takes him instead a year and a half to pay scott back like w scotts got twentyfive thousand dollars just to lay around like that you know and thats the way his brother is you know very and hes just hes just mea to scott he says things to scott just like oh just awful things about gay and well why does scott say something because scott hasnt dealt with his gayness himself and he hasnt dealt with who he is mm and thats why he doesnt say anything so you cant really blame the guy in the sense that he doesnt know hes hurting him if scott doesnt stick up for himself right and i keep tell scott youre gonna have to say something because all of these things are hurting you yeah and scott like oh it doesnt bother me and im like then why are you talking about it i said i if that would have been my nephew and he would have said that to me idve knocked him across that chair i dont care how big he was uh uh oh yeah uh i said my nephews d my nephews and nieces do no one of the little gi f uh tried pulling something on we went shopping and tried the little attitude in the in the mall and i grabbed her and i said i dont care if you are my sisters child i will knock you across that bench in a sec i said i dont have to take that i just its you will never go shopping with me again um i just dont believe in it and i i im sorry i was not hit as a child but i also was n nasty like some kids now hes right they do talk bad some of the kids say things but kids always do bu thats not an excu exactly hello hello whats wro its jimmy why why uh uh okay alright wel yeah if you dont have enough gas and youre worried that youre gonna run out i wouldnt go anywhere ei so why dont you call ill call you later on okay bye hes afraid that hes gonna run out of gas getting over here well why doesnt he get ga i dont know he drove all the way back from green bay with just on that and he thought he was gonna like make it and somebody would be open and im like so he said hes like its he said its like past empty its past the e and so hes afrai that hell run out on his way over here and he probably would oh well he should just go to a gas station so he said hell well theres one down the street from his house but itll probably be open tomorrow morning oh its not open now so he said hed just rather stay home instead and i said fi go ahead and stay home but i dont know i i really think that it its hard its hard its it is hard having to hi this like scotts doing i couldnt hide it any longer than he has hes hiding it way too long yea no i couldnt hide it that long either i told my mother when i had like my boyfriend moved away she s is that why you told her mm cause i was really upset and then i s an then shes like well its a good thing he moved away cause he was sort of effeminate and i was really offended thats how she took it yea and i was really offended cause she said something like well its a good thing he was sort of weird i didnt like you hanging around him and i said what do you mean he was weird and she said he was sort of effeminate and i was like well what do you mean hes gay or something shes like well i think he might have been and i said well uh why does that bother you i said because i am and shes like no youre not i know you youre not gay and i said yes i am i said how do you know me better than i know myself and shes just looking at me and she was like really upset did she tell your dad or did you tell your dad no she ended up telling him i think eventually but not right away first thing i had to go to see a a psychiatrist oh she made you go do that mhm i went oh jims mother told him that too see and then i went and the guy like really nice and hes like well what whats why are you here tell me whats whats going on and i said well how old were you at this time nineteen and she said thats for the psychiatrist at nineteen she didnt think you knew enough about yourself at that age right well she didnt wa to believe it you know yeah i guess you cant blame em some to some extent so then i went to the psychiatrist and hes like well whats the problem and i said well my mothers upset because im gay and hes like well it sounds like she has a problem then did he really say that ye he said it sounds like that shes the one with the problem and i didnt even th about how i s it i just said it you know and he interpreted w how i said it as how it wa you know w which is true and you know whats really f is that a psychiatrist would say that and knowingly know that you know he accepted the fact that yes you are gay that it is something that like when mike told his friend julia mike was telling me that julia said oh i dont li it but if thats what you want maybe thats not truly who you are you know and i said to mike i said then mike she didnt accept it a he sai well i think she accepted it she just said that and he told her that he feels he was bo with it and she said no i dont believe that i think its your choice that thats what you want and i said to and i and i told mike i said you know i hate when people say that because if i felt that was my choice i dont think that wouldve been the first choice i wouldve picked oh go no and its not to say that im ash of being gay no uh what it is is that because of what society has do or has laid the ru for us i dont really think i would have chose to be gay i i wouldnt why would i want to be gay and have to deal with what we go through exa and thats what i ex to my f now and and they uh totally believe that its like hereditary or genetic or whatever that its not a choice you know because they do believe it now oh yeah they totally b oh i believe its its i dont know if its hereditary i do believe its something its a ge or its something right i i do think i dont care what people say you you are you do not choose unhu ive known since i was gosh probably i can remember four five years old i remember that yeah i re looking a my uncle was sleeping on the couch in our family room an he was sleeping there with his boxers on and his peepee fell out of his pants and i just stood there and stared at it an i was and i know it was a sexual arousement cause i can remember feeling sexually interested and so i was like four years old so i knew then you you kno what you feel insi you you c you cant right and i dont care what anybody says a a f at four years old i pick i chose that that i liked what i saw i dont think so i dont think i knew at four years old that i could actually just say oh wow i wanna play with this guy you know right i dont think so and and if they say things like oh when i was maybe s i slept with my cousin tommy who was probably twelve thirteen at the time and i slept with him no he was sixteen shared a bed with him and he uh started fondling me and i enjoyed it and i fondled him back and i was like seven years old and i i dont say that he did it to me he molested me or r or raped me as people are saying now the older uncle generally i think these kids hm not saying adults shouldve been more responsible my six cons cousin should have been more responsible and not played with a sevenyearold child but he did but im not gonna turn around and tell my aunt well gee your son mol me as a child is he gay no hes not gay well we dont know a i think he is he brought home a drag queen for christmas last year so oh yeah but at the time no he ha like when he turned twentytwo he got married and he had kids and stuff he has kids which doesnt mean anything there are a lot of fags with kids but he just is very that was what ha to me and and i dont blame my cousin it was just another awakening experience for me i mean there were several experiences when i was growing up i mean i remember watching one of our neighbors who was taking a shower and you could see right through his bedroom and he got out and he was naked and i remember watching and i remember being mesmerized by his body i was never really that mesmerized by a females body as i was by a males body and so right thats why i dont understand where uh they come up with this of its your choice its no i i know that thats what i felt well i remember when i was li i was like probab three or four and i was wrestling on the i th i remember wrestling on the floor with my brothers and being aroused mhm just like goofing around and stuff like that mhm and then i think the l the experience when i was younger and my uh brothers had friends over i remember the f he he he come over with these friends with these guys and i would just be like in lust for these guys i mean i must have been like nine or ten and i was just like idolizing these guys like oh my go wow i remember i would like imagine like if i could have them in my bedroom see th yeah that type of thing you know of oh if mhm li as if they were like a to or something that was my older brother because my older brother uh played football at perdue mhm and i used to go to games and i followed him around hed take me for weekends and then id get to sit in the locker room and these guys would like tickle me and hug me and i was just a little kid cause i probably mm i was probably about ten at the time ten eleven and they just thought i was the ni little boy and i just had and i knew it i was always sexually aroused by it and and you know these things and you know its ins of you a mhm you know what what do you do and i know my brother who lives in dallas uh the one that played football at perdue he he knew it he he knew he knew especially after ron because when i left california i didnt come back here first i actually went to dallas because my brothers like come and stay with me thingsll work ou and you can look for a job down here a so ron f to dallas and went to my brothers house and banged on the door and said i want to see him we need to talk and my brothers like this is really odd for two friends to be this emotionally atta and i was like crying all the time and like when ron came i started to crying and i was just like just tell him to leave me alone just get him out of here and blah blah blah and oh my go now you tell me your family doesnt realize now what is wrong that two friends a having a th a thing theyre fighting each other th one guys standing outside the house at midnight screaming let me talk to him let me talk to him it is a little weird you know so yeah i think they would figure that one out yeah and my brother had met ron cause we went down there on a vacation of spring break once and he thought we he was really cool and stuff so he really liked him a lo until that episode and then uh i havent spoke to my brother to be honest with you since really uh why w was he like upset uh no h i th im afraid oh im afraid that hes gonna come right out and ask me oh about it and what happened was i ended up leaving dallas and coming back to wisconsin like a week later but doesnt he come up here ever for holidays at all or anything i wont go home when hes here are you serious i wont go to indiana uh see i dont have any family in wisconsin my family all in indi mm so when he comes home like if i know hes coming home for thanksgiving i wont go home he did call me one time because he needed me to se sign a property agreement some property we own jointly mhm my theres eight of us that my grandparents left us and he needed to borrow money against it so he called and left me a message i wasnt home i was working a he said ga me his number and told me to call him ba and i called my sister and said fine send me the p tell him to send me the paper and ill sign it and i never talked to him so i havent talked to my b see ive been in milwaukee for ten years s about ten and a half years wo how old is he hes a lot older than i am cause if i was ten and he was nineteen so hes nine years older than me oh so hes hes older hes in his forties yeah hes in his fort dont you think its its more that you were just nervous at the time well now im gonna tell him ive t i keep telling myself every month call him and just tell him because i wanna go to dallas and i wanna i i miss my brother he was my best friend and he knows he knows but i just couldnt just come right out and tell him then i couldnt tell him wel there was more to it than that ron came to the house he had a gu they had to call the poli he had a gu yes and he was standing out the house saying im gonna im gonna kill myself if you dont talk to me just tell me a th there was just so much to this who this is the guy who doesnt know hes gay or isnt sure if hes gay yes yes whos now in the air force and lives in th in south carolina so wait a second i thought this w guy was go was married ron ron hes married right thats darren oh im thinking of darren right no darrens the other guy that was also in a frat that i knew in college the one that i told oh those frat boys are too much i know he was the one that i told that if hed had told me he loved me i would have never left washington and moved with ron i would have stuck with darren oh i would have n cause i never really like i said ron was my friend and i knew ron was my friend a i was in love with darren when i was in college and to this d if scott wasnt here and darren wasnt married to a woman i would be with darren he was probably the best s partner i uh could ever imagine oh my god and we never had sex hes the only person i know who kissed me when h when he kissed me i just came right on the spot you never had sex n you know not the booty dance the booty dance uh wo we had u you had oral sex oral sex but he was just oh and fi and i dont like men with like auburn hair but he had auburn hair and these turquoise eyes and he was like six foot and just oh and he still is i was just like he is to die for i thought why i was so young then and so stupid he was the one that blamed me he wouldnt speak to me for six months the first time we messed around we were drunk and we messed around and he wouldnt speak to me for six months and said it was my fault that he knows hes not gay but yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor he confronted you and said that to you and got on top of me i called him oh the next day after it had happened and he said i dont want to talk to you you took advantage of me when i was drunk but hes the one that grabbed me kissed me took my underwear off a he started it you know i knew what i was about i didnt get into it but i knew right and he was the one that was the first experience and then the second experience he didnt speak to me for three months uh because he blamed me for that and then the third experience he blamed me for hes been blaming me for all of these experiences up unti uh li scott and i got serious like the year after and i was still k of seeing darren i went out to washington and stuff and thats when he sto blaming me now he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me and he called like he called me last week and said he wanted to be with me youre kidding no but hes married to lauren and i keep telling him get out of that relationship before you have children just get out of it dont carry any by baggage with you always my biggest theory dont carry any excess baggage mm with you and he lo her but what he doesnt know how to separate is he loves her but hes not in love with her you know what i mean he he just right right oh yeah you can love a person but youre not in love with them its not sexual yeah and thats really har becau you you find it very difficult to be to love someone and when you tell someone you love them they misunderstand what love is all about so i dont know but i d i i think if there was ever anybody i truly but he k he everybody has that one person who breaks their heart and he broke my heart just incredibly because i wasnt really in love with his looks i just ive never met anybody who when you they touched you just there was so much warmth and so much just there was so much energy there tha i mean so youve kept in con with him uh mm yes since nineteen yeah thats ama ive been here for all this time what does he just call or you call when hes no he calls me i cant call him oh actually i can cause his wife knows that were friends but i dont choose to call him he like he used to travel around the country they live they used to live in valencia california now they live somewhere they just moved cause his wife got a new job he quit his job for her for her job cause she moved to california for them cause they were living in washington dc so he used to travel all around the world well whenever he come to wisconsin for the dairy expo or hed come here go to chicago for some reason to take businessmen around what he did was uh he took f uh farmers around from arou different parts of the world so that they can look at farms so his travel a lot of times was in wisconsin because of the farms here they would see how things were done and he he like took them around the world you know doing this and he traveled all over the world see tha why i think darren no is getting to this point where hes with lauren all the ti and before darren traveled like ninety percent of the year he was gone i mean darren was gone ninety percent of the year so now hes with lauren ev day and its been this way for the last three or four months and i think k oh thats all for the last three or four months oh he just started stop theyve been married six years he just stopped trav oh and i think now its just like i dont know if this is for me i dont know if this is right and hes starting to call me and hes starting to tell me how much he cares for me and how he has feelings for me and i i know that youre with scott and im just li and im not giving up my life for you he asked me once right out of college when he moved to washington dc when i came back from california and i was here and i had just started working he asked me to move to madison to be with him that was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe i am gay and i said well why dont i come out there first and well see so i went out there and he goes well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment whereas he owned a threebedroom hou and lived by himself and im like okay can i afford to move out here get a apartment until i fi he never said move in here with me until you find a place or whatever it was just li and then he wanted the still straight life and this and that and other so now he claims bisexuality but hes moving closer i think to steps of being gay because when he was talking to me on the phone last week he was telling me how much he still loved me and he doesnt know what to do about this whole sit how could he really love you though he doesnt know you that much he doesnt know me because in the last ten years we talked to each other maybe once a month well thats quite a bit though and actually maybe not even that sometimes its every other month when he was traveling around the world like he went to germany for six weeks and he sent me his frequent flyer ticket cause he was there training to t speak learning to speak german in a sixweek course and he sent me a free k to to come and spend a week with him and i said no but at that time i would been with scott like four years and i was just like i dont think so youre not gonna use me for your little sex thing for that week and then thats it so i mean i st i love him i real do but hm i dont i also dont trust him i dont think any man who is as sexual as he w is uh and traveled as much as he did could stay celibate or or stay t t committed to his wi right i mean when y i saw him once in chicago i went to chicago about four years ago five years ago a he was in chicago in this really nice hotel and he said why dont you come and you know i free saturday and sunday why dont you come and i said fine so i took the train to chicago on saturday and i thought okay no big deal hell have a room with two double beds no it was a kingsize bed so i thought okay no big deal i took a sleeping bag just in case so here i am taking my sleeping bag i roll it out on the floor and he goes uh well you dont have to worry you can share this bed with me i love lauren and no i take that back it was more than five years ago because hes been married to lauren for six years this coming may no seven years this coming may so it was m than six years ago because it was when he asked lauren to marry him it was right around christmas time so its been about six and a half years so he asked lauren to marry him and he says i really love lauren x im gonna marry her and blah blah blah this so i get in the bed i thought fine no big deal im wearing my tshirt and my underwear so i get in the bed and in the morning i wake up and here he is fondling me so im like okay so do you leave or what do you do you know so uh im like darren uh he goes just dont say anything and i said darren this isnt right you dont really want to be with me you just want the sexual part and i said thats all there is to it and i just cant do this and he accepted it and i i dont know he always and hell always ask me well hows scott how is your sex life with sco are you happy with scott you know do you still miss me and im like well darren i havent told you i missed you in years what are you talking about you know its like k excuse me uhuh uh is he like full of himself or what and hes another one too he knows hes goodlooking he hes another one when we were were in college he knew it mm and and what really gets me is th uh that i think the reason i always attra like i attracted a lot of football players is people always got the impression i was gay so if they knew you were gay and they wanted some experience and they they didnt want to approach another say man in your fra and they kinda thou you were gay and nobody really wanted to like say it they would approach me mm so i always got all the goodlooking ones to always like come after me mm and thats how i ended up with ron and how i ended up with darren and i and i realize that you know i always think well especially ron i mean he was just like oh just perfect well darren was too but darren a lot of people dont like auburn hair or reddish brown hair they dont ca care for it but ron just is just a just a beautiful man they both were but i find that thats what happens in these fraternities is you find a man who is curious about his sexuality and if they find someone who they question okay is he gay or isnt he gay then they will tend to go after you a little bit faster so then you think okay youve seen some of these guys in the bars and you think like i was out at the triangle and i saw this guy he was so goodlooking im like how the hell did he end up with that thi and then i thought you know i betcha hes just out and he was from marquette and he was just finding out and he met this guy and thats why he was out with him oh you know i mean when was this it this was probab this was a while back this was they young yeah well the w oh they were young the one guy in particular was young the guy that was from marquette mm was probably i f i wouldnt think he would be more than twenty twentyone i couldnt but he shouldnt have been in the triangle if you want to know the truth so but um no he was just very ni ow is he still a virgin uh just out of cu he bought a hook but w he a virgin when you knew him i meant has he ever had a girl where he didnt have to p her oh oh he got like i told you about the time he got like a blowjob at the lakefront no you didnt oh no way um well what happened was i was just uh me and janine well let me back up here i started hanging out with janine janine and i got s and we like made out at the lakefront i dont need the de by the way i saw the janine last night oh cool hows she doing okay i havent seen her in half a billion years so um but anyways we were like making out and stuff at duncan lakefront so thats what we regularly well not regularly did this like th two three times something like that so after victors after tom had two women like fighting over who hes gonna go home with he went home with this like uh one other girl like a heavyset girl and me and janine and all of us were walking dow the hill you know going dow where the pier is except we were going down that big hill and its like uh me and janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part and they went around so we hurried up and went in the grassy part by the tennis courts it was real dark and you couldnt see us at all after we had gotten to that little plank so we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to we sat and looked around and tom and them were yelling and screaming for us you know and they started making out like a hundred yar away from us you know but theres trees and they were standing in front of a tree so you couldnt see them and we were sitting by like a tree so you couldnt see us so they were making out and were sitting there talking and stuff and junk and then its like all of a sudden we hear and that was just the damndest noise and a very distinctive noise so im like i know theyre not doing what i think theyre doing and were looking around the corner i couldnt see anything and then all of a sudden i saw tom i dont know took a step back or something and i could see tom or something i dont n know on this side of the tree and then i saw a head or a movement lower than what i saw tom so then the picture became clear that hes getting uh head from this chick he didnt even know and that was kinda cool so i dont know if he so did he do her or did he just get the blowj j the blowjob its like it was getting late and she had to work in the morn but and thats the first chick i ever saw him with here in the united states otherwise hes only paid for it you know did he pay for it back home or yeah fifty bucks for hookers well its kind of a good price i mean nowadays here youd have to like you know pay fifty bucks to go out to dinner and a movie and then you have to be uh real nice and then maybe just may something mi happen i she likes you and if the winds blowing in the right directio and just no one tripped over anything earlier in that day and well take fifty bucks go get a hooker and then go out with your friends and have some fun or you could always go down to that one strip in chicago

everything yeah my social life is going downhill well my social life is n going downhill because everyone i know is getting old which really sucks sh football i hate football yeah same here everyones getting ol no one wants to drink anymo everyones got girlfriends that they care about i know its like i dont even hear from gregg anymore whats up with that i dont know he uh kathys gonna be go for two weeks so so all of a sudden he its like hes gonna spring back into our lives hoping prob i dont think so well ever since he heard that i was having problems with my band you know hes been calling me a lot more weve been hanging out and stuff i just really uh thats what pisses me off cause like uh the same thing is going on with uh with marlisse you know its it was like all of a sudden well here we did all this stuff and for about a month now shes had a boyfriend m and i call her shes never home its like uh i got a hold of her yesterday actually i mean i even tried to call her on new y on christmas and she wasnt there a now its like im like uh where the hell are you you know and i havent seen you in a while mhm like x im sorry and then shes going out of tow florida for till like school starts now on the third yeah so it all sucks i remember this story it all sucks because its one thing like for me and you to hang out and stuff like that at victors an whatever but were at two to totally different social levels i mean its easier for women to walk into a bar not know anyone and then come out knowing everybody its hard for a guy to because then he comes off like a big huge pervert so id have to be chasing you around and cramping your style its just cool that all the girls go out and all guys go out and if youre two social whatever at the same bouncing around know everybody level its cool you know cause i dont wanna sit here and drag you down and stuff and junk cool you remember this story no what is it this this guy this is a true story uh he took a its well it took em like tw over twenty years to catch this guy he went and shot his entire f and then disappeared well so why did he shoot his family cause he was afraid that their morality was going downhill well yeah so he shot his mother his kids and his wife oh and his daughter uhoh then the milkman comes i can kick em i can kick em i i dont think its all sick and twisted you know the last time i s seen gr it was like last night i was f uh watching you know it was like i was at victors and all of a sudden i saw showgirls mhm was on or on videotape now a ah cool shoot her dont have her look at you that was the last time i did anything with gregg though that was when oh and you know what also hap is like they wound up not their bod uh since he like cancelled all this stuff and like he pulled he had said its like uh you know im pulling my kids out of school im taking em out out for a vacation and shit and all this and that so no one suspected that the family was dead for how long a month or two months wow so they were like laying there in the house and all of a sudden its like started stinking and someone walked in the house and found all their decomposed bodies and he by this time he had disappeared cool cool cool works for me thats ru s after twenty years they could let the guy go you know he killed his whole fucking family though yeah thats twenty years ago he didnt do it since at least theyre now moral ts wha i cant believe your rationale you know i was just joking i would never like you know s think about walking up th behind someone with a gun and like p the trigger and watching your brains splatter all over the nice white i mean i mean all over the wall no im just joking just wanted to scare you a little bit did you catch the little reference to wh wall you know whitewalls see get it no im just joking i wish i was at metropolis yesterday i think it wouldve been cool i think gregg and them would have been a little bit more motivated than at the planet you know cause theres no foo or nothing we didnt have food either well that s new years are going downhill now we used to i think i liked her before with all her chubby stuff yeah i dont like em b thin i still dont i think shes ugly yeah still ugly yeah i know but i like i dont like like s skinny railly r poking me in my like whatever you know i like it when you can like poke a female a she jiggles for like two seconds after i like i like that i like em h i like when we can sit d to ro yeah well then i dont understand why you like rita cause shes got like awesome eyes oh but shes like a s shes like a walking s ma i agree but shes got nice eyes i mean i i i like her but um i mean we never i could never date her cause theres a difference for me i like a lo of people like for instance um your friend oh beth x yeah i could date her did you just like accidentally tell her what i told you to tell her yeah whatd she say well actually she was interested in that guy at the country kitchen i know that s my hearts broken im sorry mm now do you see why i didnt go yeah but it turned out he didnt even show up i guess ahha where good f t you can tell her i said that too and its got me on t saying it damn it wow cool to just burn his house no eighteen years let the guy go ooh this was the first time that it was done wow recede hm wow t hm why wouldnt you leave the country i would leave the country yeah id be pissed though i mean twenty year to get away with it all of a sudden poli ba i dont know why its like why would you wanna stay there uh stay in the united states if i would i mean uh if you could commit the perfect crime get away with it would you stay in the country or would you leave itd be kinda hard to like go to a like another country you know espec well i mean he had like twenty thousand dollars okay in nineteen seventy in seventy thats like so so its like all she had to do he had to do was like get on a plane go to england get a work permit and shit mm had some h had a thirtyday head start yeah thats true plus he was already at airport couldve jet somewhere yeah woah i wouldnt carry my own paperwork forget that im g i wouldnt carry it t ah jee i it uh in i mean its its kinda reminds me of that co its like i im surprised something like hi di you know like uh dahmer and whats his name mm that other guy mhm did happen to him cause theyre like weaker type men you know in prison theyd never survive i know not if you hurt women then you become one even though it wouldnt be ba well to have some guy named bubba well we wont go there well that doesnt b reading those b is like oh my god its like there theres this one like they tell like the different guys point of view sometime and this one guy he uh there well actually they tell like a couple different guys n point of view and the guys get raped too ah and then like and then theyll like take these b plugs or whatever you wanna call em and theyll sh it up their anus and they have to walk around with it ah and then they have its like sometimes theyll like stuff this other gag in their mouth thats the shape of a penis and like tie it on their face and they have to walk and its like this one guy was t say it was like they got sent to the village which you dont wanna get sent to the village but they do and they go it was like this one guy he gets this master and he winds up the master fi falls in love with him but he was like like the day before he makes him walk around hes like a m human pony and they stick the the thing up his anus and its got like a horse h a tail a tail yeah and he has to run around the city hes like pulling a cart with these other people pulling this cart around with this thing up his b mhm a it was like parade around like that thats cool ah oh and im just sort of going ugh why ugh so na why is it nasty i dont know its i was talking to my one friend to uh her names leah and shes iranian well actually shes quite cool shes m shes muslim its like she uh shes not a virgin but uh ooh she could be stoned go ahead but i mean but shes been raised here ah really is she single uh no shes uh ac actually her boyfriends coming in from morocco okay no i was just joking anyways but but can i see your marlboro case for a second just keep talking and uh anyway she uh they ran out of marlboro lights at work so i had to go to marlboros and then ill t show you something about these okay but uh anyway we were talking cause its like i was telling her uh we were talking about this these i was telling her about the books i was reading and then we got on the subject of anal sex and i told her i was like well i remember when my exboyfriend tried to get me to try it but i said always told him no mhm things are meant to come out not go in in that hole hm she said that she had done it like twice shes like oh my god i feel so dirty whenever i do it and it hurts so fucking bad mhm and that convinced im like okay shes like dont do it ever mm cause the one thing thats like when i what when uh lamar kept pressuring me to do it and she said that like when you in the muslim its like if you do that you know its like in islam youre cons not considered muslim anymore oh if you have anal sex but i remember like uh lamar telling me once that he had a girlfriend back home a she didnt wanna lose her virginity they were gonna have sex so its like instead they always had anal sex instead wow and im like ugh ugh wow okay what are you gonna show me this is interesting i didnt know this until like i l i listened to def comedy jam this guy was telling jokes about marlboros and how theyre racist did you ever hear this no did you ever notice a marlboro the sign that this thing right here the filt the whole red thing the red thing okay okay now y are you watching me yeah its a kay theres a kay theres a kay okay you with me unhunh so heres a kay heres a kay heres a kay theres no kay three kays oh get it never even thought about it i never did either until i looked at this and im like well theres room enough to put another kay here you know somewhere but theres not get it yeah theres no kay anywhere else three kays t but its i just thought youd find it interesting anyways cool okay what is this guy doing now hey man hey good to see you we i see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there i did we im glad you didnt hurt yourself too bad me too and she says youre getting better already so thats always a good sign yeah i mean i couldnt i couldnt begin to deal with the slightest pressure yeah give it easy easy yeah dont tha still hur back here yeah yeah well you dont want to stretch see what happened you st ch according to this other guy you stretched your ligaments in there and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together keep it from flopping around so if they get you know stretched just a little when they try to peel down and tighten up and you dont want to you know get em too la while theyre trying to tighten you know you want to let em heal as strong as they can i mean you can move it im not saying you got to go around with it just totally but you dont wanna stretch those ligaments very much when while theyre healing just just gra bring it around okay are you u any kind of walking aids hmmm nope just walking around hunh yeah i had for the first two days i had a crutch or two okay i switched from two to one like a cane and then i yeah okay uh it was really icy there so i it had a spike on it so i oh that was neat yeah peg it in the ground if you forget and walk inside with your spike i guess youre not too well appreciated no bet you no let me set you up there is it okay if i record this i i alread have sure its for a pro sure sure cool alright what are you doing over there i thought you were doing something different i thought you were working with languages in okla hunh or in california i mean well yeah y california your basic pro i wa in linguistics thats what this project for yeah thats but i did a year of it an decided it wasnt quite what i really l quite quite what you want okay yeah it was an unfortunate cause i really dont know quite what i want we thats alright i mean theres a lot of things out there youll find something i hope so you know uh i move to o x completely my son is still flopping around he he uh graduated from medical school this year and uh i mean hes in uh soho in new york reall s an art career so so you see i mean a lot of people you know i mean hes gonna paint for a year and just see whether he can do well enough with th to cause he doesnt want to be a doctor after all well he couldnt find anything he really wanted to do you know i mean he did he spec at all he well thats what i mean no he hasnt specialized yet but he couldnt find anything that just really pulled him toward it a so he said well you know i guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and hes gotta scratch that little itch i think good for him a so hes up there and hell give it a year and see what happens and the same for you you got you got plenty of theres uh fortunately this day and time i think it allows uh one to proceed like youre and youre proceeding and hes proceeding and i think it i think its the right thing to do i wouldve d i would probably do the same thing were i you know another generation down the line you know although i r uh i didnt make the wrong decision for me but im sure i would have been a lot more uh uh i guess diligent in in working it out beforehand but in in my time you know you really kinda just there wasnt too many things to do you know and you too many opportunities and so you just kinda chose between a few and that was it yeah so a little simpler lifesty in those days tell me where it hurts uh still a little bit back here mmkay doesnt feel quite normal back there un okay it originall hurt on the si yeah the sides dont hurt mu it would not a i think it did at fir mmkay at first great he drew some blood out from here the first time yeah i saw that you got a little bit of blood not too much thats a good sign too cause usually when theyre torn bad they have a lot more blood than that is that doing anything nothing bad really which one hurts more ba or forward theyre about the same about the same theres just this sense of constantly not being quite right mmkay well see let me show you something over here watch this one see im pushing ba now yeah and im pulling forward and it you get a little bit of pull coming forward it it moves out a little bit and but when you go back it kinda tight its got a good catch to it you know mhm over here were gonna pull pull it out wow it doesnt have that same movement its got a little more forward movement and it kinda has a kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there so uh chances are youve uh hurt that uh ligament in the back too uh the crossband m yeah the call we call em the cruciate ligaments he calls em the exban or whatever they are yeah i dont know what th they they cross and one they cross because ones going forward and ones going backwards and they keep you from going forwards and backwards is basically what they do so hunh pretty logical arrangement there mhm yeah it is your posteriors messed up a little bit well can that get better u mm get a little better maybe its not gonna get all the way right mm itll be a little bit of a problem im not sure you didnt maybe have some of that before i dont really know uh let me see w how much this hurts here mm none mmmm good my main physical activity for the past year and a half has been aikido which is a pretty gent art mm mmkay lot of rolling lot of the knees do take something from that i believe that they a lot of work on em oh yeah sure any of those things gotta put some kinda stress on your leg you know i definitely want to get back to it though i had to lay off it for a while that hurts right over here okay mmkay its not too bad though its just ve mi uh that that one could probably see look at the difference on here now what see see how much of a jiggle you got there you got just a little laxity there righ m and this ones just a hai different i mean it but it hurts a bit uh a little bit it hurt a lot at first but its just a hair and uh so if you just let that one kinda heal you know which i think its gonna do cause you dont even complain much of this over here you know when youre doing things youre thinking more about this back one and thats the posterior exband if you want to put it like that or posterior cruciate we call it uh seems to be the problem but its not uh im not sure you didnt have a little bit of that problem before it isnt all these years since the wreck the the legs never felt you know like it its never been t norm but mhm mhm i just got used to it did your knee did your knee feel like it would sorr that hurt a bit x where did that get you over here again yeah right yeah okay thats okay did your knee feel like it had some play in it you know it wasnt real steady i dont remember that being a being a complaint while you were doing your martial arts stuff still hurt a little bit too i injured the front of the knees when i was dancing for a while i was dancing with kristy hannah here few years ag and mhm there were some times i came down on it and it did some xxxxx but that was impact injury yeah right lets see how rough that is let your knee down alright now straighten your knee out yeah youve got a little put your yeah put your hand you feel it yeah its x but thats pretty typical how about this one you got anything over here ive got a x no thats pretty slick just a little click over there yeah alright uh hold your leg real strong there let me pull on it and lets see if we got a pretty good muscle there is that hurting anything mm kay alright well i i think uhm you know i i think probably its mostly posterior cruciate not so much anterior cruciate which is good um the medial collateral ligament that l here is just minimally hurt uh i think so of that posterior cruciate was probably already r there and the reason im saying that is because it really doesnt hurt that much when i pull on it see the this is the one that pulls on that it feels tight though a bit mhm when i push back im pushing on it thats and and thats not bothering you very much but see this one has been hurt and when i pull on this one that does hurt y it it hurts so i mean you know i mean pretty simple you know if if theyve been hurt they gonna hurt when you stretch em you know so thats why im thinking that posterior is probably a lot of thats been there you may have hurt it a little bit more you know and y so you got this one a little bit and this one a little bit both of em are a little both of em can probably heal up if you let em a no need for surgery to make it better no unhunh and uh the the outcome will probably be pretty close to what you had before in other words i i may have lost a b but its not yeah i mean you know five percent or something you know what i mean you know i dont know you know youll just have to try to have to see how it plays out but it its gonna be minimal and you can z you can overcome that a little bit by getting your muscle in better shape there are two things that stabilize your knee this is your knee brace the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee thats what holds it together when youre doing things in fact you know all the sports players they their ligaments have been stretched so much and repaired and stretched and repaired that they theyre just not much good and they really have to compensate with their muscle power is what they do they do a lot of leg lifts s right uh you know just just uh you can do straight leg lifts or what we call just those little short extensions just put a bolster under behind your leg right here extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg like this do little short extensions with weight mhm and keep working up on the weight mhm you wanna b you what you wanna do and you can just do isometrics you can just l your knee real stiff and just tighten your muscle hold it tight as you can for three seconds and then let it rest for three seconds and then tight for three seconds and then rest and you dont have to move it when you do that uh uh all kinda ways so just whatever the day will al permit i mean if youre sitting around and you got some time to do some isometrics you can do that and then when you have other time you can do the weights but keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the plan you know so uh you know i think i think youll find you you do pretty well do you think i can go back to aikido and stuff probably as long as its not too too violent you know its more form and shape and stuff or its its not too much contact its about but no its ideally its about blending its about blending with the attack its not about meeting the force with force so okay theres a lot of rolls okay mm well i guess if you got good at at doing it you know where you didnt wasnt getting yourself in awkward positions and you know getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something you know you could probably handle it okay i think i think youll youll be able to see for yourself because once you get your muscles strong you get this thing controlling your knee well youll see what kind of knee control you have itll be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control to do that what do you think the lesson should be from this i mean uh this is the first time ive ever been on skis i never did it before my wreck so i guess the less w one lesson is ill probably shouldnt try skiing anymore i uh he uh you know if it were me personally that would probably be the lesson id learn from it cause im lucky it wasnt worse when i right it was a pretty bad fall right the the incline was about i dont know what grade but there was a turn in the wood it was this was in the woods yeah right and it was cro country yeah so i didnt know what i was doing my girlfriend had taught me i had been skiing for two and a half hours i was tired and we were getting close to getting back and i got uh carried away she showed me how when youre in cross country when youre about to fall you just sit down oh o but i didnt do it right so there was a turn and then i and the skis dont snap off of course oh i know and so it stuck and i kept tw you and the knee took all the torque oh and i didnt know what id done i screamed and she helped me and i manage to somehow i dont know uh s somehow managed to get up and hobble on the ski pole all the way back to the cabin oh my god and then we had to call the uh s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to oreille which is a ski resort geez we were in the m of nowhere hunh im a little i i think its been three weeks now i i was hoping that you know you told me or doctor smith told me that you know with chronic osteo it could come back from impact and i was and i really hope this is not the time you know ive made it how many ah thats unlikely ive i have not spiked any fever or or seen any signs of yeah no its it looks pretty g i think i may have gotten lucky yeah if its not hurting up there the pain would be probably your first warning sign and you know if that ever happ ri you could start feeling some cha in the the status quo you know changes i still feel yeah it feels b pretty much like the other leg i mean good thats great wonderful solid great well love it well im glad you didnt hurt yourself its a cheap lesson right thats right id say so yeah i i was out we were out and the kids were skiing you know and i was watching em go down and i was thinking god that would sure be fun you know and then s just barely my common sense won out and i decided not to do it but you know ive had two discs taken out of my back my neck f for a bad disc i dont need to go flumpitybump down the hill you know i dont need any of that so you just have to have to kind of draw a few lines mm but i came close to its tempting to trying it its tempting its very tempting it was fun i can tell you till i fell oh go its its just great you know but then id have to pay for it for the rest of my life but i didnt know whether i wanted to do that not a fair trade not a fair tr no i wouldnt do it ch that bad odds good to see you come see me you know whenever youre in town i will and uh let me know what you get into im sure itll be something fun i hope so i think it will see you byebye okay okay just let us know if you need anything okay okay yeah i tell you man that factorys the pits ma whats new last night i got into a hassle with james boyd im in the cafeteria yeah and i took a break that was just a little bit too long man you know yeah i can imagine ha hou brea you stretched a fifteen minute break into a half hour break to a half hour and then he comes into the cafeteria and i thought he was coming in to

the bottom of the thats the last thing you wanted to hear yeah really uh this fucking mayate you know getting on my case yeah well thats nothing new its nothing new its always been like that its its p for the course man right yeah definitely ts why i cant take that that type of living anymore even is this uh career doesnt work out for me ill find something that will some else well youre gonna do real estate maybe right def im i got my books and everything ill be studying and uh but in a sense i need uh some type of steady income but but uh you s th the competition man i mean is it real tough like on the lot yeah it is theres def and theres guys thatve been doing that four or five years and and theyre real good at i th are real good at it an they know how to talk to the people and they know that when somebodys coming in if theyre buying or not oh they could tell right aw y but that all comes with time you know and yeah and theyre pretty helpful with me and uh you know itll all come in time right i i figure the more cards i get out the more people i talk to n the more cars im gonna sell just all comes with time once i get my experience ill be up there too in the top four salesman your parents dont know yet hunh n theyll know when they come back i and i think my dad told me yesterday theyre coming back the fifteenth or sixteenth yeah def i think s uh its gonna be the fifteenth which would be on a saturday i think and ill be working till nine oclock so theyll theyll be pretty happy for me more or less because uh they didnt want me to work in the factory much longer yeah i know my mom doesnt know what to do to get me out but they didnt take a trip through brazil and ar i dont know i dont know they they they didnt they spent the whole time in guayaquil yeah i think so they tol my dad told me he was gonna go to uh argentina and peru and colombia but he only wrote one letter and and they were in uh no ones called em y i mean no ones talked to them no x he sent postcards to everybody and a letter but yeah other than that he hasnt called or told us whats up and hell be in here no time is he staying over at miguel juarezs yeah yeah and uh the other architect is his nephew or something pe pedro cruz pedro cru yeah hes a architect or i nev met him i know miguel thats his ive been to his house a number of time his nephew th one of his brothers sons or something unhunh but uh theyll come back theyll be happy to see me here tha i got a new career going and uh they werent all heartbroken about you know jeanie and that well they have no ide whats happening right now they must have been they have no id xx when they left we were on shaky grounds but uh you know they thought it might be able to work out so when they come in theyll be pretty shocked yeah and and hurt but uh like i say things will work out f for the best what about her folks theyre not sorry at all hu n uh in fact ive seen em i i w i went to church with em for the last three sundays really with jeanie wow she thought it might you know help our relationship as friends and uh she still considers you man hunh exactly she does because i mean we went to church together for the last three sundays yeah and then then we went to the movies after and her her folks were at church and you know n afterwards her mom w had a injury on her leg or something she wasnt at church last sunday we went to the to their house uh and uh i went over there and her brother was there her nephews and nieces her sister our godson and uh you know it was just like everybody was real friendly and every yeah i dont know if the parents a awa that we did you know break up separate but it possibly was for the better cause they they didnt feel comfortable with us living together anyhow yeah right thats not looked on too good hunh no so w what they what they probably think is you know that we still have a lot of love for each other that m out was the best thing but sh until we bo are ready for marriage and if she s loves me a i still love her and we wanna get married theres still the chance of us getting back together and getting married this time yeah so i mean it i think things are working out pretty good she called me the other day and uh you know she calls me and talks to me and i call her and ask her how her day was and everything yeah what what does uh your sisters say n they tell me to stay away from her dont even call or anything yeah wait till she calls you and everything but uh you know thats not right yeah thats hard man i mean if she accepts me calling her and she doesnt tell me dont call me or theyre telling you that why to like uh cause they feel that shes gonna get too strong by me you know uh kissing her ass oh or something or or or exactly crawling back i see and begging her uh you know for me to come back or she gonna get the upper hand exactly which which you know uh she probably already does but um yeah im not gonna just wait for her to call me because its not right i have feelings for her i wanna know you know how shes d doing im gonna communicate with her thats all there is to it its not like i w im asking her you know let me move back in or you know im sor i you just yeah i just wanna remain friends with her and find out how shes doing yeah so they they tell i dont tell em i call or nothing you know and uh and i sent her flowers last week i sent her flowers to work yeah the day before i moved out jus to tell her i was so about everything that had happened and that uh you know i hope we could remain friends and that god brings us back together if it was meant to be yeah and she was real happy about this she said that really meant a lot to me you know that you did send me flowers and uh and then then the and what you wrote yeah exactly cause she knew it came from my heart no matter what id put her through and everything she knows deep down inside i really did love her but i had a problem or something yeah you had to get something out of your syste and y but i dont even know what it is in fact i might have to go to therapy or something to fi out because theres no theres no way i i shoul you know you should be like this exactly i mean an people say you x y act out of uh its okay most men do look at other women and uh you know things go through their mind and everything but that im impulsive id act on my impulse

theyre really oh good yeah i think s theyre warm yeah hm t yeah uh yeah this fee warm yeah eventually xxx x but its amazing and theyve done so they all done now my whole neighborhood well no because they ordered the wrong storm doors they ordered the wrong color so they had to bring those back and reorder the white ones u cause they brought black by mis but thats the only thing they got left to do uh i think they finished the painting why what were they paint well they put new walls in the living room soundproof walls on the outside of of the house and we have double windows now in the li room on the out of the house no oh that was good dad at least its not a seagull i but it look like it john that thats ed i was af th a seagull got me boy oh me up poor john they did paint the trim on the outside of the house oh now well get a napkin no no no no oh al no well get a napkin somewhere dont worry about it hm x x x its me there was a whole bun of them what did he do spit on him this this is whatd you do nah he just dropped some uh spit on him no he dr he dropped s this isnt x xx here dressing all over johns pants s on it its just me you know coffee stains on the sh this is the guy that we thought had one outfit annette john likes it gives it charac for three years un you looked in his suit yeah gives the pants character oh leave him alone hes got a tooth you cant talk if youre not gonna sign my form oh g i remember a time when i tell you i feel better already johns shirts were all cranberry just listening to those guys putting those windows in in one afternoon and his s all had double stripes i say better them than me i kn it i know that feeling oh yi but they paint thats like anything they p the inside the wrong color we had ordered this well you got it on jo u well like an eggshell color be thank you linda the color that we had the woodwork in the dining room similar to that thats good was on their list of colors you could use xx hm so thats the color we h wanted them to paint the inside trim of the new door they put on the the h ca and the trim but theyd brought the wrong color paint so they painted it white the first day and the guy pat said he came in he had been at unemployment when he came back he said the guy said to him oh my god we painted it the wrong color i just realized it dont worry well be back tomorrow they came back the next day put two more coats of paint on the right color mm good work but they stai the doors yeah but the longer theyre there and polyurethaned them and every so what did they do you gotta realize the longer theyre there the longer their jobll last well no but they its done its a money basis they get paid its its a they get paid per job it was a contract bid so they get paid per job yeah but i imagine i imagine they also have a little thing called cost plus oh well probab yeah they probably do but yeah they dont do anything for the government unless its cost plus no but when you c i was telling john i just did an ad for the patriot yes when i was in work ninehundred thousand dollars for thirtyfour residences in east boston and revere so our contract was similar so its its an average of fifty thousand yeah you know between f thirty and fifty thousand depending on how much they do in each house like some people didnt want the rooms done we figured our living room was so big why not take advantage and have them put new walls oh sure you know might as well get everything xxx fif thousand might as well not take everything theyre willing to give you yeah thats right thats thats what we said gotta so and al the ceiling fell down already so well but they didnt do the ceiling unfortunately because its not on a top floo are they gonna replace that no that doesnt go with doing over the room the ceiling isnt considered part of the living room no o no o if that room is on the top level of the house what did you drop if its on the top level of the house they would because they needed to soundproof it al theres nobody oh the girls are in there but theres two levels above so they didnt have to unfortunately hunh so what time im curious now what did they do to the walls oh wait till you see what they did in the living room when when we get the walls painted and everything youll all have to come over and just see oh is the room smaller or something now did they they went in five inches on the two outside walls they put in they studded the outside walls from the inside you know the inside of the room u and then they put insulation and then they put soundproof boards then they put two layers of threequarterinch drywall and then they taped it all and skim coated it its beautiful oh they skim coated it too yep they didnt just tape it yeah oh and then they put a primer coat of paint on it so all we have to do is go in and paint it they put new woodwork along the bottom and all new woodwork around the windows danny and i got crap woodwork ev all the room windows had to have woodwork for them to so that room out back that used to be a porch m dan and i put wallboard up and then we got this garbage trim that was on sale for three ninetyfive they replaced it with the stuff that was thirteen ninety five mm yeah had to put the you had to go through the aggra uh of put it up spending the money on this trash it had to be there before they would replace putting the trim up before they would work on it mm come in and tear it down and replace it although did i tell you that guy that put the ho just to get an remember the guy that put the hole in the back of his house because he decided hed like a picture window in his kitchen and they wouldnt re it they did cause there were oh they di y he threatened to take them to court oh i thought they told him so they re they put in they told didnt they originally tell him he had to put a yeah he had to put a window in uh well that was the guy that used to live around the corner from mom and dad now how much the patriots losing by that died he died right after they put the window in it was almost s in the fourth well thatll teach him are they winning no theyre losing is that plugged in yet buffalo was driving em or what of course theyre losing you might oh well well you know the you know who i mean the guy that used to live around the corner xxx x xx that during bussing had the illiterate spelt wrong on the side of his house oh yeah yeah the italian guy that l you mean the guy that lived in charles yes yeah you can watch x xxxx he moved down near me that was in though lucy yeah that was a that was a ga having illiterate spelled no i dont think he did he didnt know how to spell it mm that was jane well it was close but it was a ga he probably didnt know himself no im sure he didnt he went and looked it up in the dictionar so that he could spell it wrong on purpose yeah but the windows al are al is smoking this this wide now theyre the living room windows its two complete windows they have and all of the windows are four sheets of glass thick there are two levels on the top and two levels on the bottom with double glass so i have to open in every room i have to open at least two windows to get to the screen and the screen is fulllevel from the top to the bottom of the window mhm theyre really nice xxx xx xx unfortunately so how is that for washing your win were three years too late did you leave it over there you can pull cause i just brought this one down they each panel comes out oh ni and you wash them from the inside oh they xx x xx three years ago they put central air conditioning but they stopped that because the federal government decided that it was extrav use of money oh ma cost prohibitive too bad they c oh oh god they did it in too bad you couldntve got in on that connecticut connecticut and rhode island got the central air conditioning ah but they didnt they that good for about three grand yeah they stopped it by the time could you move your house over there john they got up here and have the planes go over i know yeah you know actually though you can still hear the planes we may i was just gonna ask you i mean its not it s sabina said she had hers done last fall and she said she could notice a b difference in the winter but in the summer when you have your windows open anyway oh yeah it really doesnt make any difference for her well thats why you shouldve made a case for the air conditioning thats right you know i wouldnt have to open my windows yeah i know but that that was what the d the guy that came the first day from mass port said boy unfortunately youre a couple of years too late for the air conditioning ah that would be beautiful x how much complaining can you do what did they spend on your house oh it had probably twentyf thousand it has to oh more than that dan thirty thousand more more than that like i said uh just give me the money and mhm you can have the house well start somewhere else it is a really strange regulation though u did all this work just so they could come in and tear it down so that you cant s come tear it down i know and get in the carpen way but they you s a c really that you cant sue them for noise pollution for at least twenty years after the work is completed but since but for them it uh you know for the workers themsel its like hunh the room was b the room didnt even have anything up john there was no no walls nothing we put the walls up they couldve just p opped them yeah yeah they c just popped the windows out without any trou hm put the windows back put the new win in yeah they had to come in and tear stuff down yeah and of course the stuff that we put up wasnt first quality because w why would we spend the money yeah if theyre gonna replace it if they crack it so everything they touched did they take the woodwork down we made sure we used stuff that theyd crack that danny put in your k itchen yes they put up stuff that was worth three times the money and they told you to f you had to do that well it had to be existing in order for them to replace it oh we had to fin that whole secondfloor room they had to bring out whatev you know the it was like a tradeoff ah what did they do upstairs lucy anything u well in the you know the r theres a room off my bedroom that used to be a porch that dan and i put the walls in mhm that joe built and then we put a cei you know it was the r the room that joe built house that joe built with everything in si all the windows were sideways they hunh we went in and we just threw up wood to straighten every out and put woodwork on they came in and they said while we were working on it they said oh well gee you really need two sheets of sheetrock at least for insula for soundproof insulation if you dont feel like putting it up well put it up when we come in so we decided not to b hey let them do it why bother let them deal with it mm you know well we put one ceiling up sure we put one up but they put the second one uh and they re you have a f and they put the stuff in between you had to have it fini well you had to have it finished anyway for them to tear it down well then we put but they were gonna put in the we p the baseboard heat we put electric baseboard heat in u because it had to be a heated room but they put all new windows in and we put up the junk woodwork and they put up that was a hm it was great working in that room we wed make these measurements like you had to measure you put up a piece of plas uh plaster youd have to measure like how about every two feet along so they because they had varied so much you know itd go from like its just eight feet l in one spot to like seven feet six inches o here or something but y but that wasnt bad when you consider that joe used old doors that he found in garbage buckets from other peoples homes oh is he well uh did he have uh frank out uh did he have uh frank out hunting for em in the he probably did on garbage day can you get them to put some of them toilet seats in yeah that they put in the uh navy sevenhundred dollars ap oh they come close dad i didnt see in lucys house yet but i dont have to cause johny gave me the the guided

glass windows in going out to the porch and they tore them out yeah rep that stuff they replaced em with was like fivethousand dollar door or something yeah that was what j s theyre asking for yeah because the insul is unbelievable in them three panes of glass yeah fifteenpound brass handles on them x mhm now they use all brass they put a uh our front door has two locks now it has the the one like we had the deadbolt and then it has the knob lock but its y you use the same key for both of them and thats all brass they put all brass fixtures on the french doors in the living room those

said because it was an inside wall drop the pants off at the house and ill wash them john yeah but doesnt that uh dont worry about it they said it wouldnt affect the soundproof one way or the other x throw some shout on there doesnt the noise come in from the room from the dining room i dont know im im not gonna complain you know how can i complain now all we need to do is something to make that roof stop leak leak stop h you have oil heat in your house forced hot air yeah forced hot air so the air conditioning would have been a bree for them to put in i know it would have been a breeze for them yeah just throw in a unit outside yep threeton unit or what are they called m and uh hook that right into the central air i i was talking to jimmy yesterday he was in at the coffee shop and he said hes been f fielding calls all week from neighbors who would love to have their house done but its a matter of point two decibels the people dir directly across the street diagonally from me couldnt get it done because their decibel level was s point two and it had to be six or something gee s like that w so it its a matter of percentage points and he said theres nothing you can do its a federal regulation its fda that o is danger is hazardous yeah to your ears they have a cutoff to your hearing yeah and the other isnt and he said they have to put a cutoff point and if they start changing their regulations then people who had theirs done three years ago and their neighbors across the street couldnt the neighbors across the street are gonna be coming after them you know so why are they attacking him because you told him that uh no no no you know these guys i dont know the neighbors i dont know those people oh so all of my immediate neighbors had it done oh except for a few that refused which i i couldnt understand yeah why they would refuse but god thats ridicu i know i would take it i know it they dont want people investigating their house annette yeah that or they like the house the way it is theyre just yeah no because now theyre kicking themselves there are three or four of them that said why did we ever refuse if we had know well i suppose at the at the time you at the time you think about having all those workme mm coming and going in your house and are you home and all that stuff mhm but they had big meetings and these people never bothered to go to the meetings to find out exactly what they would be doing and yeah well y i c some people just get s yeah you know i could see my mother yeah doing that maybe yeah yeah if its an older home you would think theyd wanna take advantage of anything they could get yeah you know to modernize it mhm or just to make it more e yeah but no or yeah y i know what you mean but some people are just so con you

where they have kinda like a food court so were in the mall at least once a week unhunh which is ba well i watched don i watched donahue well i didnt watch it i went to work i taped it and when i came home i watched it and they had a show on about uh mostly about doctors and then hospitals too unhunh horrorstory type things oh joy remem that book yall sent worst pills best pills oh yeah i dont know if theyre the same guys but this is best uh good surgery bad surgery oh is it wolfe is his last name wolfe i d know is he one of w he said ne uh na raiders it wasnt uh uh ralph nader wasnt on the show and i never heard him mentioned oh but this guy was some kinda oh i wrote it down medical society but its not connected to the medical profession its like a medical investigating place oh that sounds like a good u because like they have one guy on there uh he went in for arthroscopic surgery on his knee almo he had last rites twice and all kinds of stuff unhunh and he got so bad the doctor di him the way that one doctor did you operate and then leave yeah town a anyway he almost died too he almost died twice evidently they gave him last rites twice yeah but u uh just they held up the book but they didnt say who wrote it they didnt i told janine i wish theyd given that address you can send a write off for it you know i wish that a lot of times it seems like when ill i wont care about itll introduce something on the today show or something and theyll be talking about a book or an album or a cd or anything you know and i dont they give it in the beginning and i dont really care that much and then when theyre done they dont tell you what it is again yeah and then i n then i care you know yeah yeah and that s sounds like well beca no i had this on tape though and they never did i think they in the guy period but they didnt say he was the one who wrote the book hm all so all i got out of it was the name of the book you know what if you go down to m a lot of those book stores ill bet you theyd track it by name and yeah you know you could find cause you dont you can do it either way yeah not that im planning on having surge well i th of going back to an orthopedic doctor and seeing if they could do anything about my foot or my ankle whatever it is thats giving me trou yeah you know i thank god be they w you know how theyve been talking about what was it those uh screws that they w uh theyre okay for different parts of the body but then they some of these d orthopedic surgeons were going and putting em in the back mm and theyre just deadly i mean these people are just in unbelievable agony and well they what about that uh people being operated on on their jaw oh that tem stuff and they would and theyre putting in this stuff that would had never been tested i dont understand this s it was some kinda teflon material it had never been tested on animals even or anything hunh and this guy started it was a doctor he invented it and started his own business and sold it to other doctors oh wait a second u was that just recently on the news because that se or was it okayed for it was on uh like one of these uh fortyeight hours or something like that yeah i wonder if i saw the similar report because that really sounded familiar a they they had some people there who had had the surgery and like this one day uh uh l all she she was in so much pain all she could do was curl up in bed all the time yeah a that sounds like those screws things that the one i was telling you abo yeah yeah well i dont know these i think they called em hinges or something hm so u terrifying i dont you know well i very brie thought of having my jaw fixed for uh see my bottom jaw doesnt come up quite far enough yeah a u i tell you thats im gonna have to be in a really bi i i ill admit ive had bad experience but im not volunteering for anything uh surgerywise well see mine would be more for looks than anything else oh darlee it doesnt chang cause my jaws dont hurt youre li your looks are fine uh dont ever take a picture of me from the side i saw me on television talking and they had a side angle and it looked terrible yeah but youre probably extremely critical too and everybody else probably wouldnt even yeah you know because this guy at work uh well they had they had it on the night before its back when they had this san antonio housing authority putting the houses in your neighborhood and they put three on my street you know i said hey if you wanna be fair about it spread it around the neighborhood dont just put em all they put all three on my street a they put what on your street uh public housing oh yeah they do that a lot in a lotta areas theyre doing that around here too yeah but this is usually its uh uh p uh oh what is it its on the cords uh something with a number in it xx hold this xx hu i not like hud yeah thats how they thats public h theres hud and then theres something else hm i dont really know a uh they check on the stuff and all at least san antonio housing authority does well its real funny one of the guy is uh family is and its uh husband and wife and two ki he works for the city he works for the city dogcatcher i dont know how much they make but like my house d good thing i bought it when i did my friend up the street she pays almost fivehundred dollars a month house payments this guy gets his for ninety dollars a month yeah i mean give the people who arent maki the money a break but one fifth you know how much could that person be making less than say danny right now u yeah i dont really know but so uh other than it looking kinda t they just got all kinda planters and all kinda crap piled outside they dont they havent gotten to the point of putting their old water heater out there or anything like that theres one h when they started all this we somebody got a list of the houses on this one u subsidized thing un and uh me and about five other people drove around to all these houses to see what they look like a about half of em were as nice as mine or nicer s kept up you know m then some of em had better uh landscaping but you know like i keep my lawn mowed and trimmed and all that about half of em were as good or better than mine which thats fine yeah they they uh i thought they were doing a real good job the other half they long weeds and stuff was the least of the the problem this one house had it looked like an abandoned junkyard it had so many old appliances and broken down shit out in the front yard i dont know what the what the thing was but you find people do that if they were my neighbors that all all i mean i hate to say it a lotta times the people in our neighborhood that do that theres no reason for i cannot i dont underst of course i dont know their finances yeah i mean you know right im not into their books or anything but i i there doesnt appear to be any logical reason for it to me theyre just pack rats yeah or something i dont know yeah but if hey if if people had to come to my house and pass one of these houses that look like that i know its depressing id call the health department and tell em its a health hazard cause i think it is yeah well its gotta breed rats and stuff yeah all those little spaces they can get into and stuff yeah i gue i gue probably itd be a good place for em to get out of the sun or get out of the cold yeah thats true but evidently that one house i i went by it about a year after that a it was still the same way worse wo hm yea more thi it gets but i dont know uh i guess uh i wish i could think of the name of that other program see this one guy at the store had a house that he bought and then he couldnt afford the house payments anymore so he got with one of these u support thi and uh like hud and i cant think of the name of it and they guaranteed him a residence section eigh are you talking section eight yeah yeah a it worked out good for him otherwise he wouldve lost the house eventually he got it back you know he took it off that and he got his finances back in order so he didnt lose his house so it worked out good for him on that and he said the people that all the people that had rented his house he said section eight that uh section eight people kept up good with it and checked on the people but on this other program it didnt look like they did yeah so a hunh but so what did you get and now how did we get on that hunh i dont know how we got on that i cant understand you i dont know how we got on that no i i dont know oh i we were talking about books i dont know how we jumped to that uh but what was i gonna oh

okay the next case will be uh walter komak versus rose black is this contested no just wit and case no oh okay are you x are you the uh plaintiff yes no im the defendant oh but i 'm the plaintiff on the countersuit oh let me have this pen for a minute oh xx thats never worked yeah sign here yes okay now this is a case that a v originally was filed by walter komak who is now present uh not present against rose black u asking for a security deposit and since hes not he uh we will not rule in favor of him and then there was a cross complaint defendants claim uh by uh rose black for fivehundred and thirtythree dollars balance of rent due at the end of the lease and miss black i presume youre the landlord is that correct yes mh and was there a uh written agreement or a uh lease yes was it a l uh month to month or a uh a year a oneyear lea o year lease let me see that please o so now uh how do you arrive at the five thirtythree you say that they that mister komak owes you uh this was the u breakdown of the security deposit let me see that please so there was original security deposit of eighteenhundred and seventyfive dolla thats correct and then you did some repairs on uh reinstalling screen r okay how come they were it was necessary to do that uh they had removed the screen okay alright and then u they owed some rent they were behind in their rent uh they were not behind in the rent the the lease was terminated because of their behavior they broke uh s one of the conditions of the lease which was not to disturb the other tenants there o so i had to give them a threeday notice to leave t uh threeday notice to quit well i know but normally you would give em threeday notice to perform uh x o one of the covenants such as uh keep quiet they were not able to be quiet uh uh u what ha okay so then they so then they left within that three days no they left a month later at the end of june they paid the rent for june okay and they left uh july first and there were two months left of the lease d xx and rents uh thousand uh twohundred twelve seventy five o mhm now u did you rerent the rerent the premises yes i did as of august twentyeighth so it reduced uh that sevenhundred three to five thirtythree uh seven thirtythr im not sure wh where the seven thirtythree comes in seven o three was the bal that they owed me seven o three after they moved out right but theres a credit because they m you got thats correct okay so youre giving a threedays uh credit and how much is the daily rent mm it was fortytwo fifty okay so how much do you say they now owe you fivehundred and thirtythree dollar and i dont and thats what you put down on your cross complaint thats correct i see mhm o well that seems uh fundamentally fair and theyre not disputing it so i will grant you your request and i will hand back your documents thank you very much and how do i get them to pay go to the small claims court office they have some paper work thank you xxx theres a smallclaims advisor that you can ask thank you okay the next case will be uh mitchell roberts versus uh matthew collins abc builders interiors this both sides are here is this contested x whos mitchell roberts right here okay sit on this side here xxx sure whos the party being s served you are thank you nice pen alright o lets see whos here now mister roberts right here and you brought an action against uh matthew collins for um roughly sevenhundred dollars for labor installing a carpet t uh during last uh august to september okay and uh just tell me about how you arrived at uh this claim uh i was called by matthew here to do the job for him so i went out and looked at the job okay you run a you run a a carpet business i presume yes im a licensed contractor okay u the job was out at ucsb i went and estimated the job for myself to see if i could take the job for what he wanted to pay for it and i let him know that i could not do the job i wouldnt make any money so uh upon me telling him that he offered to pay my employees fill out he had em fill out doubleu two forms all of em and he paid him to lessen the burden of payment on me so that i in turn would make more money off the job i agreed to that after about ca uh i that a normal procedure xx not at all he wanted me to do the job so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back so that i could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on so in other words your your helpers would really be his employees for the purpose of this job thats correct he had em all fill out the plo proper forms so then your costs would be reduced there as far as thats correc a uh i went to receive my check of which we had agreed that he would deduct the amount of the hourly wage that he was was this a in writing or verbal completely verbal ive been working with him for like six years uh upon a reve uh uh receiving my check uh for about two and a half weeks of work approximately between fifty and seventy hours i was paid threehundred and sixteen dollars and fiftyone cents so i approached him with it and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here and noted that what the employees made a uh at twentysix percent less deduction on these two employees which was the employer contribution so i noted to him that he was supposed to pay that he said uh n no youre gonna pay it so i said thats not as per our agreement he said yes it is he handed me my check rolled up his window and drove off and hes there to state hes he saw that and was witness to that i have a letter i don i dont think its relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off x we i know but that that was the end of our thing i tried to contact him everything finally i uh contacted my attorney id like to present this letter to you here okay if i may look at that and have you shown that to uh mister collins yes please yes he has he has received a copy of that letter now stu roberts is an attorney is that correct yes sir youre uh im his nephew youre his nephew and youre nick ro roberts nephew too then thats correct okay so uh your uncle then wrote uh builders uh a letter thats what im reading now yes sir uh i do emphasize that im reading it this is not evidence this is only y your story tha youve told mister roberts thats correct thats correct okay so really the dispute then boils down to this twentysix percent thats it sir okay thats the reason why i had him fill out that portion of or he wanted to write those checks was so i would save that money so i would do that job okay at the end of the job mister collins i know youre biting at the bit there you wanna say something so why dont you go ahead okay thank you your honor u uh pretty much u what mitchell has stated is untrue mitchell uh did do some work for me out at the college we did the anacapa residential hall a this is a eightthousandyard job that we did this summer it required us to employ oh five or six crews uh mitchell roberts was one of them that we used on the job uh mitchell expressed a desire to do the work out there he expressed he did not know how to handle the payroll most of the uh contractors here in town that are independents like mitchell dont know how to do prevailing wage statements the college is a statefunded uh uh remodel and on statefunded remodels were required to pay prevailing wages uh prevailing wages that um that indicate different levels of agility of the different men working and so uh a lot of the crew uh like mitchell who have people that work under him around town in regular situations come to the people like me and ask us to do payroll for them when we do the payroll for them we state to them up front that uh we will pay the payroll we will make the deductions and then the employer contribution which is approximately twentysix percent over and above the hourly wage is also deducted from the um subcontractors check now this uh th twentysix percent thatd be be social security and what else would it include um sorta like um th anything above that well you have you have xxx you have that i have a breakdown here of what we paid mitchells men xxxxx if youd like to see that okay i mean do yeah y you got a total of uh seven point six five percent employer contributions on the um that explains it pretty well theres quite a few deductions of course x oh and and the oh the the f the annual unemployment insurance and uh right oka wor compensatio right f fica et cetera now thats u in any payroll deduction situation you have the employee contribution which is deducted from the employees wages gross wages and then you have the employers contribution which is over and above that which the employer has to pay now the agreement that we had made with a of the um subcontractors uh mark prestons sitting here which is testifying for mitch roberts also did work for me and he was treated the same way we paid him we took his deductions out as well as that and so we uh did that with everybody okay wai uh i wanna make sure now uh that would be fine if that was the agreement now you say that the w you under you explained that to mister roberts uh yes sir before he went to work okay mister roberts did you have any conversations absolute not with matthew collins about that the reason and i stress this and i dont like to waste the courts time but my total i agree if whatever he just said right there was true with withholding and every r im that was fine it really boils down but what what was the discussion the agreement regarding this the dis x the agreement would be that he would pay everything so that i wouldnt did he say eve y everything so that i wouldnt end up making after fifty hou fifty hours work which i knew i was gonna make when i had to play my em part of an employer contribution i have my own payroll service they do all that for me and theyre very familiar with all types of pay this is why i didnt wanna take the job to begin with uh i can u he in turn i can appreciate that now okay mister collins says he denies that you said everything right he just i wouldnt i wouldnt done it well you have a different story on what the agreement was right u uh karen here uh does all the payroll a uh shes here to testify about a conversation that her and mitchell had in our office about this very thing and id like to before or after the agreement was entered into after the agreement was entered into he had been on the job for about a week or so and it was time i believe for the first or second pay period for his men uh he came into the office and had a conversation with karen about a the payroll and b this twentysix percent that were talking about and shed be hap to tell you okay maam why dont you please explain the conversation you had with mister roberts okay u he was we were going over the wages for phil nigel who was one of the gentlemen on there as to how much phil was to get for the job on an hourly basis a he had mentioned to me that he was wanting him to get ex amount and i said okay if its ex amount to phil then plus twentysix percent means i take out this amount from your check and he goes oh well then no i dont wanna have the you know take out that much so we were going back and forth with the figures and so finally this is the uh wage that we came up with which was thirteen fifty to phil and then have seventeen dollars an hour taken out of mitch 's check mitch roberts check and this is the note that id written down on that a then you can see that thirteen fifty plus twentysix percent which is three fiftyone would actually equal to seventeen o one and i said why dont you show him the note you know just the seventeen was fine oh this so d did you have that conver i dont i had that perfect conversation with her and thats very true exactly what you said but she never told me anything about this twentysix percent that was coming a come out of my check why its go ahead i was offered matthew offered me im mark preston im a licensed contractor also and matthew offered me the same situation and it was my understanding that he was to pay everything supply the glue supply and take care of my guys and make the payroll and pay all of the employers stuff if youre an employer you gotta pay the stuff you gotta pay all the extra thing but you dont have any y you cant testify unless im wrong about the conversation those two had you werent there is that correc i know for a fact that mitch was mak he was not there m and he just mentioned that he matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check he did not i worked strictly by the yard and i paid my people prevailing wages well any agreement he had with you is not relevant to the agreement he had with mister roberts well uhuh i saw the peoples checks a im just drawing a pi verify what mitch said h ma mister collins was supposed to pay everything he approached him with the same fir f f with the exact same thing and he d jerry stillman he did the same thing he did the same thing with marco villaremo whore all licensed contractors but i still i still dont know that may have been on other cases the question is did he do it in this case he it would be if it may please you uh the whole reason why im here is because he took that twentysix percent out that he told me he wasnt gonna take he used it as more or less bait me to do the job and went ahead and withheld it from me without saying a word to it i had nothing i was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job i understand that and when he wrote my check he wrote my check to me handed it to me through a window says thats the way it is and th and and you know it wasnt and he uh totally evaded me he has to this day evaded me mister roberts thats beside the point what im trying to uh we have to really hone in on what was the agreement not how he paid you the agreement was if he that you know i dont care if he folded an airplane and ma and sailed it through the air he would pay all my employees that was the agreement everything but he di he disputes that well i understand that thats why were here your honor okay but youre the plaintiff you have the burden of proving your case thats the problem i have is youve gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence that what youre saying is true well then if more more li than not now you say one thing and he says another then when when a person fills out or has other employees fill out the doubleu two forms and everything why would i become liable for that contribution when h when he in fact by law is now employing those employees hes the employer i am doing nothing isnt there a law that states that fact when you have uh people work for you and fill out specific forms to the state stating that tell me again wh what were the what was the agreement again go go through the y conversation as you saw it conversation was mitch if you do this job ill go ahead and pay all your employees and you in turn will be able to pa make more money that was pretty much it thats it thats to the point oh so he in ef said and thats it i will pay your employ that correct and he did sir and then when it came to the employer contribution without my knowledge or anything until i received this check he just yanked that right out of my check and mister collins uh that conv tell me about the conversation you believe happened well u mitch and i u mitch had come to me and said he would do the work out there but he wanted to do the work under the basis that i paid his men and i told him about what i said earlier here about the twentysix percent yes that was mentioned to him always oh yes uh always it was mentioned with karen here on her note of nine two ninetythree that she wrote down her note that she talked with him twelve fourteen and at uh at every juncture he was uh made aware of the uh the contributions were made by the employer these were his men and we were doing a service for him under this agreement that we had between us now just uh just seems from a logical standpoint i wasnt there obviously it seems like if you had said that to him he wouldve said wait a minute its not worth it to me thats cor would you would you think he would say that yes i would think he would why would he do the work okay so you would trick me into doing it tho well not if he not if he said to you no but then then with all my with my fourteen years experience why would i do that amount amount of work and knowingly for over fifty hours of work well i xx know i was gonna take him three hundred and six dollars to do it that may be a like a buyers remorse so i uh i dont well tha not i have fourteen years experience in the trade thats why i turned the d the job down to begin with without doing any work at all well ill tell you uh if mister roberts testimony is correct he should win and mister collins testimony is correct then he should prevail and i agree with you now but the fact remains that i would not have done the work for this amount of money thats why i turned the job down to begin with thats why im here in the court today to make the court decide it shouldnt it shouldnt be legal for guys to do this well im gonna make uh i gonna make uh in my mind a bad decision today now you both seem very truthful and honest i wasnt there but im the one thats bearing the burden of this monetary amount you have to bear the burden uh proving it but i understand that uh im gonna award u mister roberts threehundred fifty dollars approximately half now mister collins may not like that now y if he doesnt like it then he can go ahead appeal it across the street superior court running the risk that he might face the full amount of sevenhundred and four dollar i will appeal okay but im going to get it and uh award mister roberts uh threehundred and fifty dollars a if neither party is happy maybe theres an old saying in court that both parties are unhappy the judge made a good decision so thank you your honor make it for the uh plaintiff of thr theres some and i will allow the court costs of twenty dollars and thirty cents i think theres some papers up there thank you your honor xxx um any of you who find that you really enjoy storytelling i would like to mention that the last weekend in july in spring grove illinois there is a festival children under twelve are free ill just mention that to all you parents u a its called the illinois storytelling festival have any of you ever gone i know you have alright put your hand down uh uh when i found out i was telling here i didnt realize that dusty uh had attended your church a number of times hes also a storyteller uh from the illinois storytelling festival and uh we would love to have you all come there are four tents a childrens tent an adult tent a general tent and then a traditions tent where everyone can come and just share their memories of growing up or world war whatever o f first time you ever rode in a train all of those things its a won family event a i hope that some of you would be able to come the next story that i have is from the native americans its called how the star got in the sky did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky this is the way the indians think that the stars got in the sky and i learned this story from a white man who had been adopted into a tribe in michigan in wisconsin he has taken on a of the native american ways and the people thought so much of him that they have given him uh also a native american name and he gave me permission to tell the story long ago in the sky there was only the su and the moo and on the nights when the moon didnt shine it was very dark indeed well all of the animals got together and decided they were going to go to the creator to see if he could help with the problem well when they arrived the creator said i will help you but first you must do something all of you are to go down to the lake and gather stones now not round stones like the moon but jagged stones and when you have got as many as you can carry bring them to me and then i will help you and so all the animals went to the lake all except coyote because coyote was laz and he was a so all the animals gathered as many stones as they could carry the large animals had a great many stones and the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee they could only carry one but they all brought them to the feet of the creator all except coyote because he was lazy and he was asleep so the creator looked over all the stones that were brought and chose one not too large and reached up and placed it in the sky and when he did it began to twinkle and he said this i will call a star and this one a special star a homing star the north star and this evening a of you animals are going to go off the edge of the earth into the sky to make your pictures with stars and so that evening a of the animals gathered their stones and they walked off the edge of the world into the sky to make their pictures with the brilliant dots that would turn into stars they a went except coyote because he was lazy and he was asleep well after all the animals had gone the creator call to coyote he said coyote come on now get up time enough of this being lazy come on over here i have a jo for you and coyote he yawned and he got up and he dra himself to the presence of the creator and said ye yes what what do you need me to do and the creator said well all of the animals have gone off the edge of the earth to make pictures in the sky but some of them cant carry very many stones i want you to take this this great big ba of stones into the sky and when any of the other animals need them then you give them the extras that they need well coyote was lazy and he took one look at that bag and thought hoh i dont wanna do that but you dont argue with the creator and so he said he would and he got up and he took that heavy bag and put it on his back and he w off the edge of the earth into the sky well he hadnt gone very far when that bag started to feel very heavy and so he looked one way and then he looked the other and he put that big bag down and then he dug both paws in and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way and a whole bunch the other way and of course as soon as they hit the sky they all began to twinkle behind him and then he picked that bag up put it on his back again well it wasnt so heavy now so he walked a little further and a little further but that ba began to feel heavy again and he looked one way and he looked the other way and then he put that bag down and he dug in again flung one paw full of stones one way one the other way and no one had seen him but the sky was getting brighter behind him he put that bag right up back on his back walked a little further well it felt good for about a minute or two and then lazy coyote he just couldnt s it anymore he looked one way he looked the other then he put that bag down opened it re wi and like a puppy digging a hole he just dug all of those stones right out of that bag until he got right down to the bottom and a those stones started sparkling behind him then he took that bag made sure it was empty folded it up made a little pillow pulled up a comfortable cloud laid down and went to sleep well pretty soon the animals were running out of stones they started calling coyote we need some more stones over here right over where are you coyote well coyote didnt hear them because he was lazy and he was a well the first rays of morning started peeking over the edge of the earth and a the animals had to scurry back onto the earth before day broke some of them had to leave their pictures half done so had only had one stone they could just put up in the sky a few were finished like the swan and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye he woke up and he realized he too had to hurry back onto earth so he did but that night when he looked up at the sky thats when he learned how to howl because he saw all the other animals with their pictures in the sky and his wasnt there because hed been lazy and he had been asleep and thats the story of how a the stars got in the sky we some of my favorite kinds of stories are stories where the audience gets to help a little bit a this is a story that has a tiger and i need you to be the tiger now this tiger keeps changing his mind about things sometimes youre going to say tha goo said tiger can i hear you say that tha goo said tiger tha goo said tiger x and sometimes that tiger changes his mind and he says tha ba said tiger tha ba says tiger al well lets see what keeps flipping this tiger back and forth shall we boy was sitting on a big rock in the middle of the jungle just sitting when along came tiger r boy said tiger r and then i will chase you and i will catch you and then hmhmhmhm i will eat you so r said tiger well said boy eat me then i have no run left in me what you wont run tell me why you

came back looking for me tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger so i got down and i picked up a stone and i threw it at rhino to scare him away tha goo said tiger tha goo said tiger but it didnt scare him away tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger so i got down and i ran a little more a little slower now because i was so tired but at least rhino was getting tired too tha goo said tiger tha goo said tiger and then then i was running and i tripped into a shallow ditch right in front of rhi tha ba said tiger thats ba said tiger yes well but rhino was going so fast this time he ran right o me tha goo said tiger tha goo said tiger but i got up and there was rhino right there back again tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger so i ran and i ran until i saw uh a vi and i grabbed the vine and i swu across the river to the other si tha goo said tiger thats goo said tiger but on the other side was crocodile with his mouth wi open tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger so i swa back and i let go of the vine and i landed with a thump and i didnt see rhino anywhere tha goo said tiger tha goo said tiger so i got down and then i realized i had been on rhinos back tha tha tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger so i got behind a tree and i picked up another stone and i threw it just as far as i could rhino cant see very well but he heard that stone and he ra off after it tha goo said tiger thats goo said tiger and then tiger said and so then you ran away and you got away from rhino and boy said well n i was so tired i just sat down here and and and now im going to get behind this big stone because here comes rhino now rhino tha ba said tiger tha ba said tiger and he took off running fast and the little boy got up not tired anymore and he ran away home as fast as his little brown legs would carry him and thats good thats bad is the name of that story now i know storytelling is a new thing for a lot of you but it um if you do have enjoyment of it i hope you will join us another time at at the storytelling festival i have one more story for you and how many of you already know the story the frog prince the frog prince the prince who is turned into a frog by a witch and and then in order to is it reminding you of someone you know i h u and then in order to regain his form he has to be kissed by a beautiful princess youve all heard that story im sure well this is the story of the other frog prince it was a beautiful day at the pond but the frog prince who was sitting on his lily pad in the middle of the pond huh was he lonely i mean the bir were flying above him the fish were swimming below him but no one was paying a bit of attention to him when who should he see walking along the path with a book under her arm but the most beautiful princess he had ever seen well uh finally a little company he said to himself and he took off his little gold crown put it next to him on the lily pad hopped into the water and swam across poking his little head up through the reeds oh uh pardon me beautiful princess he said in his most pitiful and pathetic voice but uh i was wondering if if you could help me well the princess was quite surprised to be spoken to by a frog but she felt so so for his pitiful and pathetic voice that she said why you dear little frog whatever can i can i do to help you and he said oh well you see i am not really a frog i am really a handsome prince who has been turned into a frog by the spell of a wicked witch and in order to break the spell i must be kissed by a beau princess well somehow the princess had the feeling that he was gonna say that but she looked down at him and felt so sorry for him and she thought well what do i have to lose and so she reached down and she picked him up and she brought him right up close to her face

contributed so much not only to this entire area but t to the world of ceramics and also to the world of literature and been part uh of one of the great artistic movements which revolutionized the way art was considered and which today still has extraordinary resonance in the work of younger artists who are rediscovering something that was discovered at the v almost at the beginning of this century and with which miss wood was so intimately involved xxx to have the mother of dada w us lets keep xx is this it is in deed a pleasure n now i would like to hold forth but i dont think im going to be allowed to so beatrice uh it is yours is uh my voice alright like this alright now referring to that period just mentioned it a touched me by the name no no is the most dangerous word in the english language and it has absolutely changed my life for instance i was brought up very carefully i was a good little girl and i was in great revolt my mother saw that i had a governess that i went to private schools and i was in i didnt like this at all now one day i met elisa a journalist she knew writers she knew artists she lived a bohemian life and i was very attracted and interested so i invited her to home for luncheon after she left my mother said to me shes common th hurt me that was first no alright so the next time i went to see her and she had a little apartment in greenwich village and she said theres a young musician of twentysix whos broken his leg hes french hes very lonely you speak french so go see him so uh i went to see him in the hospital and it was uh varese the musician of the avantgarde music and the second time i went to call on him marcel duchamp was there the great painter of the nude descending the staircase alright marcel duchamp introduced me to henripierre roche roche was a collector of a a a diplomat uh sent by the french government very correct he called on my parents twice and after he left my mother said youre in love with that man you shouldnt see him again i didnt know whether i was or not but i was attracted alright that was her second no so very politely he called a third time and i said oh uh i was at the phone ill come to see you he said oh no i just have a little apartment in greenwich village its nothing at all i said oh thats alright i dont mind he said no no no its its not its not attractive i said lo im shopping just around the corner i see you get the point it was a lie if i ever said one so i um m decided and i went to see him and i entered his very simple little room i looked around it and i remembered there were very coarse curtains and the sun shone through them made them like gold and i stood in his room and he was very nice gentlemanly man he didnt quite know what to do so he came and he stood opposite me and looked at me and i saw a painting on his wall and i saw a glass of water on the table and he wasnt saying anything so finally i looked at him and i said arent you going to show me your etchings from that time on i was never a good little girl that it was the kind of life i wanted he uh uhuh he uh a duchamp introduced me to the arensbergs and i met all the great artists of that day and had a w time i was just i think twentytwo going on twentythree so i was of age and my mother couldnt say anything now im v international in feeling ive traveled quite a good deal and to me as i travel people are the same everywhere and in spite of having this feeling for the whole world i l that im a californian i i was born in san francisco and one of the reasons i love california so much is that its kinky and but this is very important because new ideas come up because its kinky and its just wonderful the uh marvelous new ideas that come up and of course what i like about america because in spite of being very international in my feeling i think ours is a w country were quick in friendship we are open to new ideas we made we presented many new inventions but and this is very serious ou um uh athletes our actors uh are getting millions and our teachers are being cut down and our libraries uh are being closed this is very very serious its putting a bl on knowledge china and other middle east country not other middle east but uh middle east countries and china and other countries uh are realizing the importance of education and going after it and we are cutting down in that direction and it worries me a great deal now one of the wonders of america however in spite of the bad things several years ago tony prieto uh who taught ceramics i think at mills college he and his wife uh went to europe to learn and we he rela turned he said europe shares nothing america shares and because america shares uh our craft movement has grown so wonderfully were doing w inventive things in craft uh i have been very fortunate myself im not naturally a craftsman but ive had uh fou very wonderful craftsmen to help me uh lukens at usc the natzlers otto and gertrud natzler great potters when they first came to america gertrud natzler would sit by me at the wheel and help me try to see what throwing was about then my colleagues in ojai vivika and otto heino theyve been so generous theyre teachers they pass down everything theyve helped me a uh i remember toshiko takaezu her names so hard for me to say was visiting me she spent a day and a half helping me center on the wheel all this sharing in our schools amongst craftsman themselves is a wonderful thing so the movements go on and of course uh our museums uh are so important i dont know if military minded people hope nobody from the fbi is here if our military people if uh realize the importance of museums museums protect all the great art the gr invention the creative efforts of man from the beginning of time and theyre our inspiration and i think our museums are doing wonderfully now even though were beginning to cut down on education i uh i feel about the importance of craft of bringing beauty craft into life one day i said to vivika heino because im a snob about art ever since a child ive been dragged through the museums of europe and america and my eyes are exposed to great art so i said you know its a mistake to teach cr uh pottery in high school the students havent time to make anything beautiful and important and vivika heino so wisely answered that is not the purpos it opens them to aesthetics and thats what right education does now i wonder we have a trem population in prison and its growing we can hardly house them why we put the cart before the horse we put people in prison why because they have not had right education in the beginning and r education is the b of everything now ha ill end with one other idea and then you can ask me questions and that is this since there is an olympic of athletes why not have an olympic of ethnic and tribal dancers from countries all over the world then people could come and meet theyd have beautiful costumes friendships would be made a i dont think we can have peace just with guns peace comes through friendship and friendships would be made with all these dancers intermingling and even dancing with each other because when you touch you dont shoot and uh i base this uh on a little experience of my own when i was in uh uh ojai as a sweet young thing i would go dancing at the art center i knew all kinds of square dancing folk dancing nobody cared who we were dancing with if it was the rich rancher or a man taking care of trash nobody cared as long as he was a good dancer and after every month we had a party and a of us mixed together in friendship that is w and something like this could happen if we had great dances so i come back my las word is violence never ends with violence and right education is the b of everything well i do hope that there is someone from the fbi here to re this message to the state department because if the state depart okay i hope that there is someone from the fbi here so that they could tell it to the state depart miss wood asked me to inform everyone that her hearing was rather difficult at the moment and so uh i will have to speak very loud and clearly so so she can hear what i say yes im very hard of hearing age theres no getting around it so mister perrot will take questions so if you will ask your questions clearly and please dont make them too long s because i might forget the beginning by the time i reach the end uh then i will relay them to miss wood and uh as far as i know there are no restrictions on any questions that you could ask who would like yes beatrice when did you first get uh into a living relationship in paris with all those wonderful artists at what age w w when did you get into a living relationship with those p artists in paris at what age with artists in par yes um i went to study art in paris a little bit uh but i really didnt meet any answers and to answer your question the way i think you would like it answered i was twenty in new york mhm and it was my mothers no that i was so uh really b b bothered by her remarks that i just broke loose and went in the direction i wanted she wanted a different direction social life have me married to a stock bro oh i wouldnt be here i wouldve murdered him i say this in spite of not believing in violence my wh life changed and i think i was very lucky because uh uh three uh uh oh four friends did so much to help my education marcel duchamp roche the collectors the walter arensebergs and then my old schoolmate elizabeth reynolds hapgood hapgood was co was uh editor of colliers a close friend of president wilson and elizabeth herself spoke russian so she knew this was years and years ago before even any of your grandmothers were alive uh uh uh uh it was uh uh uh she knew a the russian ambassadors pavlova nijinsky uh isadora duncan uh all those people i met through my own schoolmate elizabeth hapgood so i have been very lucky another question you fear ill tell the truth bravo nothing but how was your relationship with your mother after you broke away from her how was your relationship with your mother after you broke away from her u i broke away i was acting then in the french theatre uh i wasnt really too interested in the stage uh but in those early years i thought it was the only way i could earn money and i threatened my mother to run away so she said if you really mean that ill take you to paris and you can study under the comedie comedie francaise because she thought that if i acted in french it was safer than if i acted in america so i uh uh i was acting in the french theatre then i i was the ingenue i spoke perfect french had beautiful clothes uh for two years i think i did over sixty parts but i want to act in english and my good friend elizabeth hapgood on account of russian and knowing so many people in the theatre uh i got many parts offered me and my mother said no you get leading lady or nothing now part of me was really a good little girl part of me so i was very subdued and my spirit was being broken because shed say no no you cant do that you cant do that and then a woman came from canada a said will you come up for three weeks to canada a act in the theatre there on salary and i said yes uh and thats when i broke with my home and my mother had a nervous breakdown for two days and my father said youre killing your mother and i said shes killing me and im the younger and i have a right to live and ill always and ill always let you know where i am now i should say something nice about my mother she was beautiful and very generous but she was in a way of thinking you know we didnt have radio we didnt have television life wasnt as open as it is now and any mother would want a protected social life for their daughter probably now when she died in thirtysix i had left home then oh for quite a few years the last three months of her life we became friends and she let go of all that kind of thing that didnt interest me and she was v wonderful uh a open and the last day of her life she was dying of cancer she was conscious she knew she was going that night we joked about it and she said now tomorrow i understand theres a wonderful exhibition dont tell any of the others but go see it she knew she wouldnt be here then she was just wonderful so im very happy to be say to s be able to say we became friends at the end mhm yes in the back can you expand uh just a bit about your thoughts on uh bringing art to the prisons could you explain a little bit about bringing art to the prisons uh your thoughts about bringing art to the prisons i think itd be wonderful uh ive always been concerned about people being in prison but i really dont know very much i just think its a terrible thing that we have so many in prison and im sure we could s what is called s the lives of endless people if they had a creative outlet but what is a young person to do brought up not knowing in any way right from wrong no compassion seeing bing bing bing uh guns used all the time no money drugs why should they not steal now i dont know if this has any value its personal uh when i left home i made a very unhappy marriage in name only but the man it was a disaster and i was for quite a few years without any money and i mean i sold w my own books to get money to eat i know what it is to be at zero i was not trained for the world i didnt know how to relate to the world but uh once a week i always went back to see my parents and they never said anything they never blamed me from that time on my mother s uh she always had a very good uh luncheon for me suspecting that i was hungry and i was one day she said go up to my room and get some information out of my purse i went there i opened her purse it was f of money and i had the impulse to take some i knew she wouldnt care uh she probably sent me up almost to take some and i stood and then something in me said n that is not the way to live and i didnt take it now this is just a very poor little example but when you have no education when you havent read id read a gr deal of very fine books also a lot of trash but id enjoyed readings now you have no guide when youre a young person why shouldnt you steal why shouldnt you shoot why shouldnt you go to prison but l what were paying for people in prison instead of putting this into education you see i feel our culture misses the first sell which i come back i say is right education and of course uh from what i know ive never had children so i say this with apology but i understand that its vital for women to love their infants to cuddle their infants and from what ive read all criminals all abnormal people its because theyve never been loved as young uh youngsters yes i would like to hear something about how she came to be called the mother of dada how did you become the mother of dada do you smell the dog on me yeah okay down boy down boy mmkay jamie wrote this out in a hurry

to do it okay but if she ha uh i mean its not a big deal i just need to know if she had one done or didnt have one done okay cause itll make a difference on what the brand inspect doe okay if she did have one done i need to know about when if she cant find the copy so they can look it up okay and i doubt if theyre terribly computerized cause i had this happen once before when i lost the brand inspection on a horse id bought but i remembered the month that i bought it in and i happened to buy it out at the auction it was one of my theres a mov sitting on the desk out there what is it the substitute wife oh was that any good it was very good oh good you mean farrah fawcett has learned to act didnt we see well it was funny oh okay it was different i dont know how realistic it was i just

ill have to ask her and s im the okay im the agent lets see this is gonna go to the owner so yeah the owner would have the blue copy the a i was the agent on this horse im not the owner so but course the we got him last july so its been almost a year i just i just cant bear to bring the brand inspector out for just one horse because its only like seven bucks now this one was seventeen because hes getting a permanent brand inspection which you can keep for the for as long as you own the horse what is a brand inspection but its what it is is your only legal bill of sale for horse or cattle in the state of colo oh regis its like re a car right and and or or uh not registering but uh passing title mhm to a car an see the thing is what makes it good uh is if you dont have a legal brand inspection on a horse when you take him to the auction you cant run him through the auction they will impound the horse wow so if somebody goes and forg a little bill of sale that looks like this and steals a horse out of my pasture and takes it to the auction theyre gonna impound the horse and check it out look for identifying marks a not send that horse to the kil oh okay okay thats why its real im yeah uh how do you uh i guess you just look it up in the phone book for uh well you u you can you can colorado state department of agriculture or some i c never find it in the phone book call the

training she hadnt been ridden in five years and her um pal of ten ye ten years had to be put down a few weeks ago he just was so crippled up and old and mm s and she didnt want to keep the mare at home after they put the other horse down cause she figured shed get frantic so she came here to have more friends to make friend yeah well these are so what did you do to your arena u well last year i put in a whole new ring i spent about three thousand dollars leveling it because it wasnt quite level i id had it leveled when i moved here but it w really wasnt level mhm and the sand that i had in it uh there was natural sand in it when i bought the place it had all washed down the road and i p think kettle creek scooped it up and put it in their ring so it was hard as a rock and it kept washing out and it was terrible and like riding on asphalt so i had well you were probably down to the hardpack i was down to clay mm an i had havens come out and with a bulldozer and he leveled the whole thing he took a who bunch out of this corner you can see yeah and p it down in that corner yeah a it just was a lot nicer and then i had threehundred tons of sand brought in and spread it was great in the winter time when it was all frozen and i had this much soft stuff on top but when it thawed we couldnt ride in it it was this deep oh it was ho and the horses have had a hard time too much so today finally its been dry enough for tad to come out and and take the rest of the sand off and i sold it to him oh he was t it ou he was taking it ou oh okay i saw the big d yeah well that was havens was taking it out um orville havens a uh his son which i cant remember his name starts with an el lenny or s and he was taking it to someplace else lenny and orville he was taking it to one of my students who lives on the road behind me who put in a ring but didnt have any sand y okay o so she got a great deal she got about a third of my sand that i paid twelve or thirteenhundred dollars for delivered and she got it a got about a third of it for about twohundred and fifty bucks hey thats good and so it was a lot cheaper than if shed bought it yeah cause i only charged her a buck a buck a ton which is what i paid for it but then i had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in yeah the hauling is what costs so much but ill sh so uh yeah you know my my arena isnt very level well it cost her a lot less to level hers but it wasnt as big as mine or as unlevel this is my tractor its masquerading as an isuzu but it really is my tractor foggy meadows my handyman did that i havent seen him for a while i think he quit and didnt tell me thats my roommate one of my roommates horses is here and ones in there but hes hiding and then this is the field this is what we call the witch field the mares live out there they get turned out there during the day and then thats the gelding field and my stallion lives out with the geldings and bru stands here half the day wanting to come in and then after he goes in he wants to go out hes like a lotta peoples children in the winter time the mare field and the gelding field and the chestnut you see a dark grey on this side and then a chestnut with his tail to us yeah the chestnut is my stallion and hes just as mellow as hes mellower than most geldings hes a sweetheart a the mare and baby are up the road a half mile if you go through the gateposts th where it says stray winds two and just go through there and look to your left theres a pasture and ive got the mare and baby up there in a sevenacre pasture wow and weve got wow right now were down to twenty horses here which is great and then my roommates old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too hes um had a real rough year he had cancer a he lost one eye and the other eye is going blind and thisll probably be his last summer and mm shes not riding him a whole lot but hes still pretty happy so well put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer and see how he is in the fall and if hes if hes looks like hes gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally well put him down in the fall im not gonna let him wander around blind its not fair to him hes been a grand horse but none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life where do they go they get put down and then either buried or just hauled off but we put em down at home i dont i dont put them through going out to the sale and being menh manhandled and stuck in semi trucks and scared to death at the l end of their lives i just hm dont believe in that thats probably why ill always be poor but i do a lotta horse rescue ive bought a lot from the killers um in fact this black horse of my roommates came from he was going to the killers four years ago not this one the one that is b blind now and he was considered a killer an unmanageable and hes been perfectly lovely i give the little kids lessons on him hm so ive had him four years sold him to my roommate a couple years ago it was her second horse a uh theyve cleaned up in competitive trail and just had a great time and fox hunted him and hes just real game hm hes a purebred arabian all bla and hes just great a uh an nother one i s from the killers three years ago the l chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us yeah hes a mustang and he was four years old going to the killers out at calhan and he was way down on the sales list and he was pretty spooky so i m i had eight horses at the time so i made one of my customers buy him i said hes gonna make a wonderful hunt horse when he gets broke and he did and hes absolutely lovely and he now belongs to a sixteenyearold girl who competes him in hunter jumper gee nay and she hunts him thats great and she does dressage on him and he jumps great he does dressage he does everything you ask him to do except drive we tried driving him i used to h h driving as i putting loading him driving him with a cart oh with a cart mean making you pull a wagon yes mak him pull a cart oh okay okay well we did a the gr theres this horse was doing great on the ground wed harnessed him wed been doing for two years you know lets break this horse to drive cause hes part belgian hes pretty cute hes about a quarter belgian and he came from around reno nevada a uh so we did all the groundwork just had a great time with him a i had this guy come out that drives belgians and and he was gonna put in fence posts but the ground was too frozen so he said we i dont have anything else to do and i told him about this horse he said let me see this horse and he had belgians he said wow he does look like a baby belgian hes real cute and he asked me what id done to him and baby bel a i said well weve done a this groundwork weve drug a drag with him and hes doing really good so he put the harness on checked it all out for me cause i dont know as that much about it which is why id never hooked him to a cart we just played on the ground a um he said well everythings good he and he drove him around put the drag on him he said oh this horse is ready to drive i said are you sure i said when this horse spooks its a pretty tremendous spook hm i said and you dont want him to spook he said nah hes gonna be ju fine he hooked him to the cart he got in told me let go i stepped back two steps the horse took two steps bucked kicked the guy out of the cart took off the barn door was open this used to be set up a little differently um this fence went straight across and this was one big field and i had a different gate because h destroyed it he came out the end of the barn jumped a fourandahalffoot g the cart of course smashed the gate and he went tearing around this whole field with all the other horses in here for probably ten minutes and he jumped with paraphernalia probably straps hanging to him right no the cart was still attached the cart was still attached the cart went through the gate gee the c uh the cart went through the gate knocked the gate flat i it was one of the alum type type gates like that little one only it was the big one yeah and it was flat it was mushed thats why i had to get a new gate a uh incredible well ive replaced fences since then but he went tearing around scared all the other horses to death and there was a section down there which used to be a part of a fence you can see it see the part tha it just makes kind of a upside u yeah yeah he jumped that with the cart too and knocked it over i mean he cleared it but the cart knocked it over and sent that all flying a finally the cart wheels got smashed enough that it just wasnt dragging too well anymore and he was dragging dead weight and he fi he stopped up on top of this hill and i was going h cow golly day and in the meantime i had a little mini about this big that was out there and he got trampled by the other horses he was okay mm he was on bute for a couple days and he liked it real strange give me my bute all other horses hate it but he got tram he had hoof prints on his shoulder and ribs and another horse was permanently lame after th he was borderline lame anyway he was doing walk trot and thats all an old lame appaloosa but he broke a bone in his foot he just he made a sharp turn on the hill and just he broke off a piece of his side bone so hes retired totally now just getting fat and not working mm a uh but so much for uh carts i walked up there and hoping he wouldnt run over me with what was left of the cart and i took a knife with me and i was a and i didnt have to use it i was able to just unhook everything pretty quick and l him out of the shafts a um he h the only injury he had and part of the time the shafts and its a metal cart the shaft was under his belly and in between his front legs and i thought hes gonna tea himself apart mm no a mark on his hind legs he had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here small tiny puncture wound but it swelled up like that he did a lotta bruising and muscle da mm a um the vet happened to be out yeah i think he was he came out about an hour la ter and i showed him what had happened and he said yeah hell be out for six weeks which was the b rest of the hunt season he hunted two weekends later and was never ever lame never lame hes really tough and for three week hi how are you after i took after that when i take the cay hay cart out to feed the horses theyd all ru and

us when youre on your heels oh okay alright now w just relax im not gonna hurt you at all uh when i do the mak uh the hanegoshi instead of pulling him all the way up like this im gonna come and let go with this hand with my right hand im gonna wrap his right arm up like so just like th just like you would in a regular sodemakikomi then im gonna slam this leg up and let fly interesting theres not much difference i mean its a little more dynamic and its good when you catch a bentover opponent out there in shiai uh or randori no need to fix your gi right now its gonna get messed up bend over for me darren no not yeah bend over like a grab my gi alright from right here then i come im doing a pardon me let me go back to hanemakikomi im doing sode bend over im just gonna kinda scoop his arms up bring it across notice how high i get up into his crotch with that foot that gives me more lift to him uh bow come here bend over ive got my my high collar grip on on a bentover player who likes to watch my feet and mess around im gonna give him something to watch now im gonna come all the way around here and as ive got him w up im wrapping up tight arent i bill y im gonna slam that up im gonna come all the way around on him see its okay if i get this foot all the way up into the side of his crotch i want to r get that lift as i get that lift i wanna get that outer winding pull that makikomi okay lets give it a try bill i wanna see you throw darren we need to practice darrens ukemi i love it the only hebrew ive ever seen make the sign of the cro it takes too long to do the sign of star of david nick hush sammy davis junior used to do it just fine hajime na now you gotta let go with the right hand bill get going wrap around there pull pull outer winding pull and dont elbow me in the face ya you need to let him have a chance to slap thats good etiquette youre right watch bill from here come all the way around okay to here see how i got him up on that one leg gotta keep that on okay then im gonna kick his leg up boo in a hanegoshi that spring hip with an outer winding pull its okay if you hit it low but if hes bent over you can and you hit it low youre not gonna hit nothing from here i dont have i have too much distance between us but from here i get more of a spring off with it its gonna be hard not to call it an ippon mhm and even if they dont im going right into udegarami go not bad lug you wanna give it a try try it on bill youre in front of a black belt xx where x he can see if he wants to oh im sorry alright x gotta pull going this way okay i need to have him here jerk him you dont have to g wrap both arms up just one really uh jerk him around okay x and then spring the hip up spring your hip take a high collar grip lug if hes bent over that far you wouldnt start off like that now you can just swing all the way around and grab that arm okay just no theres no such thing as a haneuchimata you fall straight on your face oh alright you dont have the outer pull going for you you still dont have enough outer pull he oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes way out to here now spring your hip okay spring your hip there its hard too for you w your legs are so short and hes so tall try it again and martin if your hip joints were okay yeah hed b be just perfect for you to okay for one thing youre backing in okay watch from here bend over from right here okay jock him into it mhm ive gotta still jerk him up on his tiptoes to throw him from here see that half half instep spot the hip im jerking i still get under him dont i then im on him its hard to control that throw did you land off the mat no no good uchi mother koka tell you what martin lets pull this down xxx okay alright lug give a more upward round pull from here watch i get s best best way to do it is to feel it i guess bend over alright im gonna come to here now i jerk u first then i spin around okay and im gonna let it go god youre heavy then im gonna let go here here see how i got you wound up down here this is not a good throw to throw lug in i would suggest doing this throw on combatants and opponents of equal h and size lug would be much better for a sodemakikomi but not a handemaki hanemakikomi cause the hane you add that spri alright im having to use my legs to throw his weight instead of using sodemaki and get the outside of his legs and i can make that a pretty throw alright and with the makikomi technique with it you dont ha the tsurikomi the lifting pull that you would normally have you dont have your right hand to help you with it all you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand its gotta go up out and around lets give it a try throw throw bill again now spring the hip thats better yeah much better now lets throw it again and not have to stop and think about where the foot goes now just one moment the more acute angle that that knee gets at the more power w you have with your spring from your hip joint from here even if im doing hanegoshi if i get that that knee bent at ninety degrees right here well i can bla hi from here ive got a lot of spring with it also lay the instep of the foot toe extremely wellpointed to the inside of his calf i mean his his uh thigh at the bend of his knee i dont care if your heel slides up into his crotch for a a hanemakikomi now uh hanegoshi id prefer that you do it a little bit different but hanemakikomi the higher up it gets the more spring you get yoshi is this the right position here your knees need to be bent now pull pull pull pull and spr and spring spring okay im just trying to get this this middle posi alright watch even though hes bent over i still have to get in okay ive got to get him loaded look at his look at his heels is his heel up yes alright from here now ive g im got to be lower come on back side of the hands and then i spring him off if hes bent over its extremely hard for me to get under him with a standard tsurikomi grip well this way im just scooting my butt in there on him it doesnt matter if i hit him a little bit above my his obi with my buttocks as long as that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in then im throwing my weight straight forward okay with that outer winding pull its allimportant jerk him around in a big circle okay everything was there but the leg bill went into uchimata i might have to have you throw uchimata a couple times so you can throw a hanegoshi think of it as a very short inverted kick like that you know how you can use inverted kick up v close range mhm thats exactly what youre doing kicking the inside of his thigh okay this time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it go into it and load him up two or three times uchikomi alright bend your knees as you go in too youre just straight and straight and lockkneed there 's better now throw relax relax and throw better better youre still sli up that leg youre not springing it bill lets see you throw a couple times throw me its hot in here thank you okay it was now im gonna be a sucker and watch your feet this now youre just walking in on me man you have you have no outer winding pull here jerk me to you hoo there we go im on my tiptoes what are you waiting for not quite far enough in a little shaky but basic as long as youre getting my head to where itll clear and wont snap my neck youll be doing fine make me a happy camper ah here an added exp an added attraction what are we gonna do now ive got my hand on your hip whoa there we go thats it beau throw i was gonna get that arm free stop whispering good have you played a player yet one of these you will think i did jed youve seen these havent you mhm turn on in on s with something turn in to anything ah cant can you go into ouchi now im playing you back but okay you can hook that arm o there we go hanemakikomi now ow alright boy thats a hard fall oh ippon alright thats where hanemakikomi comes in now the traditional way to do it is not all bent over its from a regular grip and ill still go not a real which w that one wasnt a very clean pretty throw xx functional ah f well it would have been better had my leg stayed lower traditional hane hane uh goshi leg there that was pretty but i like the hanemakikomi when its used on a player whos fighting you in that extre defensive stance while hes down in a deep jigo preferably with his left foot forward pressing against you with that left hand keeping you out doing this number goes in see hes already eliminated this place all you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me from there jerk hook and then spring me right there thats it alright practice it on darren a couple times i wanna see it think if you tried the throw okay can you tell on darren lugs a little bit heavy for you where is he here it is dont throw him off the mat now bill do we wanna do it using yeah ah the only thing i yeah take your position on the mat all i do is xxx x im keeping you out like that well thats fine down uh are they on the chalk yes you are okay you gonna make xx xxx throw we its coming off as a winding uchi was i above your leg it did its not the time for uh for uh extreme resistance yet were in practice okay just put your hand up there and push a little bit xx not a lot of resistance from it and xxx xxxx xxx xxx thank you cause youre throwing him over toward this edge okay thats it pu ippon alright lug lets see you throw uh throw bill okay turn and bow to that brown belt i did okay i didnt see you sorry he didnt bow to me though throw throw from there that wouldve been fine man that would have been as fine as frogs hair throw nice winding uchimata the o the only way that youre gonna get it lug is to keep practicing it alright now hook the arm hook the arm here all the way and just shoot this on across release his head and shoot the arm straight through now go throw throw there youre still shooting up with a bit of a uh uchimata now im gonna throw him with left side here it doesnt matter you can keep your right hand grip alright now im just gon gonna shoot it to here uh now im coming in with my knees bent yeah but that makes ive got him up yeah but an elbow in my f dont worry about it son im not going to hurt you im just doing komi and from the right hand side bend over put your hand against my hip hold me out okay alright from here hes holding me out i just come just like this see how i shoot this hand down i dont have to try to grab him around the head i shoot this hand down and i im gonna follow it with this shoulder all im doing is my my roll out then then ive got him a locked up now im good and tight against your chest darren uh are you yeah well am i tight against your chest yes im right against your chest no space between us one of the secrets about making this throw work bend over bill put your hand there alright from here im gonna roll it around here see how i got my chest have i got your chest bill yep but my butt is in it thats oka oh doesnt matter textbook i think about ninety percent of your problem is the legs try it on me up now uh alright im right here s get over here alright lug swing that arm out of your way swing it all the way around thats fine see im getting my arm out trying to step over now i think youre going to go and do uh a m a uh sodemakikomi this is just what it feels like from this position so im gonna get ready to step over o to get away from that sodemakikomi i wanna step so i can drop you with taniotoshi right and just as i get ready to step from here kick that leg in there i go alright come here bill watch it darren i mean uh benton alright tell me if this you know sodemakikomi now ah there we go there we go no just dont counter just step over the damn thing there alright now he stepped over so i can finish up with a hanemakikomi he off mat no he just hit his hand oh back of his hand again i guess since hes off the mat he didnt wanna hurt his arm yeah hes used to wearing a watch try and protect it come throw him a little bit benton there now th shoot that leg shoot it now ha you had a perfect position with the foot xxx jed can you add anything cause im out here on the yes in the front i cant see whats going on youre out here right here on the side xxx x ive noticed something that your sensei is doing that youre not doing hes reaching for the mat hes in there and wi up yeah hes reaching for the mat with this arm and your arms way up here high youre like way up high off the ground and your sensei is way down like this by the time he gets to the end of the throw see the difference so youre wrapping and youre thinking i gotta make this throw what am i gonna do and nick is going for the mat with this arm hes into a f almost like a forward roll mode the other difference that i noticed between you and your sensei is that this foot is way out here this the your are they trying to throw over the entire hip se with th mhm and and and and when nick throws it so pretty like he does hes got the his foot much closer to the middle of his opponents center of gravity kay s youre so wide that if you lift up when you lift up to make the springing motion what happens is you fall this way real quick that is it and you dont have enough to go like that try it one time reach for the ground with your wrapping arm uh uh uh better there yeah its better rea but reach reach way into the ground with this one xx here here heres its right here reach way like this like you were doing a front roll out xxxx and and stand on this foot so that you are more balanced just a little bit more but you youre going down i mean step in when you have his b right between his legs no step deeper wont settle step deeper okay look how d now get your foot over here bit more step right between his legs that foot now shoot your arm and and kick oh ho hanemaki woo ah so try it again alright you notice the difference in the foot position what hi what how much that helped mhm step directly between his legs with your advancing foot no no no no no ah youre not not between his leg now reach that arm reach that arm shoot it reach that arm through the more you reach that arm through l let me add one let me add one thing to it to make it cause it is a hard fall if youre throwing it contest style if youre throwing it demo style somebody once told me that that the way to practice a the makikomiwaza was to go down like this to take this foot if youre throwing righthand throws and to take this foot and stick it a the way through l thi yep and just stick it a the way behi you like this and as you go down uh and you roll like that okay and if you do this in demo uh in demo fashion youll be so low to the ground by the ti that your opponent hits the ground that youll be rea nice to him a that way i mean you can intensify you can always intensify throwing throw it harder but the mark of a good judo throw is to be able to do you see the people throw seoi so nice they can do they could throw their grandmother and it doesnt even hurt she goes ah that felt good so you can do that mm by sticking that le all the way through just like that as you get you follow what im saying yes sir you dont have to drive em through the mat that thats a way that you can practice it over and over in a demo style and be so low to the ground that its a real nice its about as good as you can get a makikomi for your uke its really not that bad and you could its its throw him and let him see alright alright s so were coming over like this coming in like this alright nice easy clean fall look how tight he is to my chest look at his body position right here there is no you couldnt slide a postcard between us i dont think youd even do it between the hip to to get the hips well do you wanna do one more yeah show him again heres a nice place to put my shoe yeah there it is mom look unhunh what look at my shoes they look like the phantom stairsteppers hunh nono it looks like the invisible man it does

thats how i remember it he died in s oh god december sixtyseven so sometime in sixtyeight we took this trip wed been talking about it for a while uh flew down to mexico city uh we c think of the name of my hotel which wouldnt mean anything now but we ended up in a fabulous hotel uh first night we were very unhappy with our rooms we got down there and the next morning buddy whos a early riser anyhow was probably up four oclock and he went down there complaining to the manager so cause it was not w the accommodation we were supposed to have had we checked in about eight oclock at night or so which is in mexico is like you know the well we ended up with a corner suite with it was so big we couldve had a party for fifty people xxxxx three bathrooms in it uh two bedrooms so they had but they had an extra guest bathroom xx big ba it was circ open on two sides of course we didnt have anybody there but the two of us and i remember the new york yankees were training there so it probably was the season opens in april so it probably was february or march mickey mantle and uh whitey ford and all of em i wish id been smart enough to know then that uh these baseball cards and those autographs would be selling for three or four hundred dollars but at any rate uh i went down there with a recorder we used to we had those things at the store that we used to u when wed go out of town and particularly if we were looking at some site o we were looking at a store when we had some comments wed talk into those things we had four or five of em aaron had one i had one mike had one xx had one from that financial guy things sold at the time for about eight or ninehundred dollars eight or ni eight eigh or ninehundred dollar uh you got a very sophisticated one but you know the little ones now about this size well this son of a bitch weighed about fifteen pounds it was some heavy son of a bitch had a pouch like sorta like youve got i carried it around well any rate my wife had fallen in lo with a mexican artist by the name of nierman forgot his first name jewish guy mm mexi national his paintings sold f fo generally a thousand dollars plus which was for me a lotta money in those days twentyfive yea ago i was no way i was gonna spend twe a thou first of all i didnt like him very splashy albert and marcia had one of his paintings they had they had i i dont know marcia had a relative in mexico or something but theyd been down there many times and and they had his book a we got down there and he wa uh all over the place his paintings were he lived in mexico city a uh we had a cab driver uh that was gonna take us to wherever the place where the go was i cant remember one of the roughest rides and if you ever been to mexico city you made that ride yeah some kinda city about hundred miles away i th we were gonna die going down there an old car and anyway well before that he took us around the city still got his car somewhere slammed the damn door on this guy poor guys hand one day inadvertently we were getting out we had him about three days one day we took him down to wherever we went buddy and sue didnt go but he took us to the ruins and all that stuff you know uh you know i and i i knew then and i know now that those guys take you to a particular place they get a commission well they took us to this guys studio he what took us to this guy artists studio uh a uh rae he was there and she saw a painting she liked a uh he wanted that damn recorder and he said i tell you what ill do xx make you a deal he said ill you take this painting i want that recorder ill take it could naw i cant do that its not mine it was its about a thousand dollar swap shit i thought my wife was gonna have a fit she was pissed off mexico city was a uh in those days probably still is not for this guy he was very successful uh very prolific but it was an art colony and there were a lot of americans down there he was not an american a lot of americans down there uh because cost of living was so cheap at the time and they they had these art shows everywhere well we bought a painting uh of a little mexican woman still got it with a watermelon on her head like it a lot think i paid thirty dollars for it well that was about my price range uh while i was down there we may have bought a couple of other i inexpensive paintings maybe collectively we bought maybe spent a hundred and fifty dollars uh hell i was not an art we werent art collectors a uh to spend a thousand dollars to me for a painting was unthinkable uh the s first painting i ever bought my fatherinlaw bought it from geri f geri rae it was one of geris original early early paintings which i thoroughly enjoy shes changed styles but whi we were down there uh you know i this it ive s that somewhere before you know ive had that painting for thirtyfive years i guess i ive never framed it and i really like it uh my my my fatherinlaw wanted to give me a painting for my piece of art for my office and so i had a we had a display guy at the time by the name of be m fashioned himself as an artist and i said ben pick me out something youve got fifty bucks to spend so he got this from geri and i loved it xx its beautiful and and i can see all kinda things in it its got a lotta color and lotta color i see a chinese junk at any rate to make a long s this fellow leroy neiman over here sports artist not the same guy as this guy nierman ive forgotten his name oh i thought there was a connection no no connection k there is a connection on the story well we looked at a lot of art in in in the in the uh parks and there at least it was pleasant weather and like that uh it was sorta like uh what the hell they call the district in new york where on sunday they put all the artists put their paintings out uh the village the village the village you know all the all these artists put their well they had mustve had three areas like that parks with paintings and my god there mustve been thou of paintings and uh most of em very inexpensive uh starving artists that were down there lots of american well uh we wandered around down in the the area which ive forgotten the area that they called in mexico city where uh most of the jewelry shops are and things its got a name i cant remember ive never been back they also had a lot of uh artist galleries down there and i walked into this gallery during one of our we were down there maybe ten days and i saw this guy nierman i never heard of him at that time he he he got famous at the nineteen uh probably seventytwo olympics uh but his c his art was already in collections of guys like edward gee robinson it was very popular in hollywood he also was very prolific big handlebar mustache and i walked in and there must have been about twelve or fifteen paintings in there they were uh you walked into his studio or it was a gallery uh he didnt live there he didnt l in mexico okay the oth th the guy n th the jewish fellow theyre both jewish okay th th this guy nierman who was a mexican national lived there okay forgotten his first name leonardo nierman or something but any rate but uh uh this guys name was leroy neiman id never heard of him well id heard of nierman uh because rae went down there wanting to buy one of those paintings these were paintings which id say were about the size of this joe namath there which is a seriograph and uh we went in and uh they were just back from acapulco season was just over in acapulco and he had about fifteen twenty paintings twentyfive paintings football players horse races thats what he did they were about that size id been in there oh god i looked at em they just struck me as something i loved em they were great they were you know very had a very distinctive style and uh the guy said uh god youve been in here so many times that said ill make you a deal you pick out any four of these you want ill give em to you for fivehundred dollars the four of em shit i loved those things i stewed on those son of bitches stewed on those son of bitches i figured i bought those fucking paintings id have to buy that damn thing for rae or id trade that cam for a thousand dollars and ninehundred dollars to buy another one i promise you as god is my witness this guys originals sell for a hundred thousand dollars apiece or more you are kidding they were he is big big hes the premiere sports artist in the world really and uh id never heard of him and but of course the price was right for me but i didnt buy em that was about that was about nineteen spring of sixtyeight and i was watching the olympics of nineteenseventytwo and hed been engaged by the olympic committee uh he was prominent then but not world famous a uh i he was up all over hes got a grea big bull of bull moose mousta sort of a deal general bull moose if you remember yep and uh his art was so distinctive and hes the sketching i said jesus thats my ma i remember seeing at the olympics i hollered and screamed and i told the story well of course since that time im on his mailing list xx xx x x one main gallery in new york that uh think distributes for him around the united states and im on the mailing list and they get today twentyfive hundred to twentysevenfifty for a seriograph of which he produces maybe three to fivehundred of em depending on the issue but these were originals i jon i promise you as god as my witness i he was i couldve walked away with those things and and uh i i i p uh uh but thats my story on that machine that damn thing and of course i didnt know obviously i didnt know what i was missing if id done id done that obviously but you know it was but still fivehundred dollars was a lot of money in those uh fivehundred dol was you didnt spend that much on the whole trip probably oh h i w i you know i w i i would s i would say probably certainly we didnt spend fivehundred dollars for uh for novelties and things of that nature you know it was you tal you talking about a lo time ago mexico city was chea je christ oh man it was i mean we we we stayed in a f rate i guess what you call today a four star hotel but hell i dont imagine we paid twenty dollars twentyfive dollars a night you know xx uh uh probably prob but uh anyhow uh i i i god i my i give my wife the story every once in a while this guys name cause uh i i i i i like this guy love him uh and of course you know ive never uh xx this one over here on the right although its signed by by n nier by by leroy neiman paul xx and a uh and is also signed by the artist it was done for a uh poster a benefit it was a poster thats just thats not a thats not what they call a seriograph the joe n the joe uh namath who was of course an ala football player yeah yeah is i saw it out in san francisco and my my my inlaws bought that for me uh but uh uh its a beauty though thats my that th thats my r thats my my experience with one of those machines i didnt have enough judgment to to trade him that fucking machine to give him the machine because id say probably it wasnt like it was like computers well in a year or so after that that thing was so impractical cause it was s heavy heavy heavy you uh and well theyre its like you s i xx eloise gave me one for chri about x this big you know and you buy one for sixty dollars eighty dollars i got one i bought from radio shack its well did rae ever get uh nierman xxx no never did get it but she nudged me when she got back but of course i guess i havent done it recently but over the years i like to tell her this story tonight because i havent thought about it in a long time and shell say to me i told you to get em i told you i mustve gone into the place fi ti you know id go in there xx and your mouth is just watering shit if i buy those but y knew you were gonna have to buy her w well if i had to if i bought those things shit id have to buy her that da thing oh aint no question and there w no question about that there wouldntve been any liv wouldnt been any living with her you know its uh y y you know h i ive gotten a lot better but in those days you know hell i was uh maybe i was s see sixtyeight seventyeight eightyeight x just twentyseven twentyeight years ago i was thirtyeight thirtynine years old and uh i i sure didnt have uh i sure wasnt prosperous i had my damn trip budgeted and uh to have gone out there and spent another fifteenhundred to twothousand dollars for artwork you know my mother who was you know strong as moose meat come back if shedve known shedve figured i needed my fucking head examined shedve deducted it shit oh any rate uh thats a good story th ah its true story good story true story it was a true story i i well it wouldve cost you that to replace the doggone machine aw idve had to replace it for the store uh but as i said it was only a matter of i guess a year those things were really antiquated although we used em a lot uh in those days and i you know i recorded the whole trip and uh you know things that we did it was a wonderful trip we had good times better than keeping a diary oh yeah a lot easier it really is uh we i keep a remember we tried keeping a diary on the china trip and man it was arduous well i keep a diary course i we we havent traveled much lately i keep a diary when i go out of the country still got em in here otherwise my problem is and its a lot easier to do it that way but i i keep i diary when i go out of the country the problem is uh with me not that it comes up too much but someonell say something to me about somewhere i s shit i i you know i i forgot where i went i have to look cause i cant remember well you go to so many places on a cruise particularly you know yeah so many places in a short time that you get em mixed up now we cant even keep our photos straight without the diary oh yeah well you know y when you get back from your trip until you make another trip you can remember but having taken as many trips as youve taken shit they sorta run together im talking about they d the ones that were fi years ago honest they do to separate the trip that you went on this one f its tough to do and uh but theyre a lot thats a lot easier than a diary then you can transcribe it but uh i dont take i dont take my diary in the domestic united states and we havent traveled all that much but i have taken em uh first trip i made uh you know o out xxx in nineteenseventysix xxx tha outside of mexico out of the country was i went to uh we went to i went to the orient on a business trip xx exploratory trip i was there for fifteen days worked my ass off but it was uh went to uh japan went to osaka which was the textile city and then uh taipei and hong kong uh and it was a youve been u but it was for me uh uh not only an education wed been doing some importing but uh through a group and it was a group of us that went i guess it probably was a dozen in our group that went there was a group of stores that we were associated with it was a a an interesting trip uh uh very educational uh still got my notes from nineteenseventysix but s and all those god damn cards you know how they get over there everybody gives you gives you yeah gives you a card ill never forget how impressed i was with of a the orientals the japanese are so bright my god and uh just uh uh uh catch on like that they jus dont they oh they really they they really they real they really they work at though man and the chinese work at it theyre good students y know well ye well you know we see listen look at these people from india what s good students they are some of your fine doc its amazing aint it yeah you know we see these people you know y you know weve talked about this on groups for years all the problems we got with the blacks i was just reading an article i believe it was the paper this morning where i read it maybe it was new york times yesterday thirtythree percent of the black juveniles in their twenties are either in jail on paro or just released thirtythree percent and then i i read in a art and that doesnt count how many got away oh thats right but thats of the uh in their twenties i read an article within the last three or four months and im i believe im correct on this figure that twelve percent of the black male population of the united states is in prison twelve per cent of the black male population as you say how many di you know how many oughta be in jail probably that many more but the point i was gonna make is and therere always exceptions uh not to take anything away from uh percy jones whose article i read this morning because i mean hes i dont know what his family had but i mean hes you know hes hes c hes hes come out of it but by and large across the board uh theyve just never educated themselves coming from these back well thats the hard p and and yet you s they havent educat themselves and you see these people come here from taiwa ko cambodia taipei parents cant speak english they come over not speaking english and they they excel scholastically in the most difficult subjects i mean chemistry physics medicine i remember one year there for at the time i remember reading the article its been ten or twelve years ago but fourteen were fourteen uh public and private high schools in shreveportbos i dont know how many there are today i remember that it was a big article that fi valedictorians for sh_just shreveportbossier five valedictorians that year were of oriental descent you know couldntve been at that ti two hundred and fif f in the whole damn area no uh you know and you think you know um and you think about the jews the irish and the blacks and its the same all over the fucking world mm and i just read an article in new york times yesterday i clipped it for my wife to read uh about the fact that in israel where they have brought in thirtythousand where do the dark ones come from ethiopia ethiopia uh and fivehundredthousand russians ha very proud of the fact that theyve been able to do this in a country of five million people uh which would devastate most countries i mean they uh its ten percent the and and the the ethiopians in particular had a big march last week because theyre secondclass citizens the jews look down on them too you know they got a they got a they got a uh a class situation they look different they and course they havent accepted the russians too well either uuh although the the the russians a high percentage of russians are according to this article uh are scientists doctors engineers mathematicians and they ed educated the difficult way on areas score score higher on the test than the than the th the nativeborns but theres a big you know theres a the the theres a theres a theres a class differential which was interesting i i really hadnt thought about it in many years how those blacks uh had integrated into the ci society i am told i havent seen any of em but the blacks th theyre not like our blacks theyre no no small you know smaller features but uh they are dark skinned and uh they look different x and uh i dont know whether there are any other black jews over there but uh xxx xxx a lot from s africa but theyre welleducated people down there a lot of em a lot of jews from south afri oh yeah im s i know that this fellow go who was a head of this uh international war tri crimes tribunal is a jewish fellow because there was a picture of him in the paper with a yammaka on mm you had to look close xx pretty good i pretty good indication well you know but uh these uh these uh what astounds me is and this goes back into nineteen lets see duna died in seventyseven or something so this this goes back oh further than that maybe nineteenseventy in uh in houston
